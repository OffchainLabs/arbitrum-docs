# Arbitrum Docs

Arbitrum Docs, built with docusaurus; docs are live at https://developer.arbitrum.io/. 

[Arbitrum SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) auto-genned docs are included as submodule.

## Contribution

For most of the docs content, you can contribute by simply reviewing our [docs contribution guidelines](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/contribute) and opening a PR! 

The following are the only exceptions: 

- Contributing to the three troubleshooting pages — [nodes](arbitrum-docs/partials/_troubleshooting-nodes-partial.md), [builders](arbitrum-docs/partials/_troubleshooting-building-partial.md), and [users](arbitrum-docs/partials/_troubleshooting-users-partial.md), as well as the [glossary](arbitrum-docs/partials/_glossary-partial.md) page — requires internal Offchain Labs access. If you'd like to make a suggestion about content on any of those pages, open an [issue ticket](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/issues).

- To request to have your project added to the [3rd party node providers page](arbitrum-docs/node-running/node-providers.mdx), use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw0U-9LcLuih5TZ_QghS-S_MS4wCKSEigA_IQEza_hFmNVow/viewform).
