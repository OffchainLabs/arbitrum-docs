## Contribution

For most of the docs content, you can contribute by simply reviewing our [docs contribution guidelines](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/contribute) and opening a PR!

The following are the only exceptions:

- Contributing to the three troubleshooting pages â€” [nodes](docs/partials/_troubleshooting-nodes-partial.mdx), [builders](docs/partials/_troubleshooting-building-partial.mdx), and [users](docs/partials/_troubleshooting-users-partial.mdx) require internal Offchain Labs access. If you'd like to make a suggestion about content on any of those pages, open an [issue ticket](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/issues).

- To request to have your project added to the [3rd party node providers page](docs/build-decentralized-apps/reference/01-node-providers.mdx), use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_v8j7sc4ffE6U-lJJyLMdBoIubf7OIhGtCqvK3cGPGoLr7w/viewform).

### Initial set up

1. Clone this repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs.git
```

2.Install node dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

3.Update the submodules

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

4. Build

```shell
yarn build
```

5. Start the development server

```shell
yarn start
```

### Dev Build

To start a build server to serve the docs site locally, run this command from the root directory:

```shell
yarn start
```

### Build

While in the root directory, this command will build the site:

```shell
yarn build
```

To test the build locally, you can use the following command:

```shell
yarn serve
```

### Update glossary

You can add any terms to the glossary by following these steps:

Let's assume you need to add the term "State Transition Function" to the glossary.

1. Create an `.mdx` file as follows:

`docs/partials/glossary/_state-transition-function.mdx`

2. Ensure that the content of your file follows the following format:

```markdown
---
title: State Transition Function
key: state-transition-function
titleforSort: State Transition Function
---

The STF (State Transition Function) defines how new blocks are produced from input messages (i.e., transactions) in an Arbitrum chain.
```

3. While in the root directory, run the following command:

```shell
npx tsx scripts/build-glossary.ts
```

This part will update the glossary.

4. Commit your changes and open a PR.

### Formatting

1. Run `yarn format` from the root directory.

### Redirects

1. From the root directory, run `yarn check-redirects`.
