# State

The State represents the complete current state of the Arbitrum chain.

- Account balances and contract storage
- Updated deterministically by the STF
- Identical across all honest nodes
- Committed to L1 for finality

State updates are the result of transaction execution and form the basis for Arbitrum's security guarantees.
