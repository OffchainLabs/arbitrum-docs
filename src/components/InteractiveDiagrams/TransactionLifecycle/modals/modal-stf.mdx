# State Transition Function (STF)

The State Transition Function is the core execution engine combining Geth and ArbOS.

- **Geth**: Standard Ethereum execution environment
- **ArbOS**: Arbitrum-specific functionality (cross-chain messaging, gas accounting)
- Deterministic execution guarantees identical results everywhere
- Enables efficient fraud proofs without re-execution

The STF ensures that given the same inputs, every honest node produces identical outputs.
