# Delayed Inbox

The Delayed Inbox is a censorship-resistant mechanism that ensures transactions can always be included, even if the Sequencer attempts to exclude them.

- Transactions enter a dedicated queue on Ethereum L1
- A functioning Sequencer typically includes them within ~10 minutes
- If delayed beyond 24 hours, anyone can force inclusion
- Provides strong guarantees against censorship

This path doubles processing time but ensures the Sequencer can only delay, never permanently block, transactions.
