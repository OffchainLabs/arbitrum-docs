# Batch and Compress

The batching and compression stage optimizes data before L1 submission.

- Groups multiple transactions into batches
- Applies Brotli compression for ~10x size reduction
- Minimizes L1 calldata costs
- Maintains transaction integrity

This process is key to Arbitrum's cost efficiency, reducing fees by an order of magnitude compared to direct L1 execution.
