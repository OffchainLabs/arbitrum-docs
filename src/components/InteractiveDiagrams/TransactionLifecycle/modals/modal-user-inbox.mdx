# User Inbox

The User Inbox is the primary entry point for transactions on Arbitrum. Users submit transactions through various channels:

- **Public RPC endpoints** for development and light usage
- **Third-party RPC providers** for improved throughput
- **Direct Sequencer endpoints** for minimal latency
- **Self-hosted nodes** for privacy and customization

Transactions submitted here flow directly to the Sequencer for ordering and quick confirmation.
