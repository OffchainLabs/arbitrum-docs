# Sequenced Transactions

Sequenced Transactions represent the ordered queue of transactions ready for execution.

- Transactions are assigned a deterministic order
- Order cannot be changed after sequencing
- Enables consistent state across all nodes
- Forms the input to the State Transition Function

This ordering guarantee is fundamental to Arbitrum's security model and enables efficient fraud proofs.
