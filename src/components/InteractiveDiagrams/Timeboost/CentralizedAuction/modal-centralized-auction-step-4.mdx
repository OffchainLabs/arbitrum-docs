# Step 4: `auctioneer_submitBidAuctionTransaction`

The auctioneer submits the winning bids to resolve the auction.

1. Auctioneer collects and sorts all valid bids for the round
2. Identifies the two highest bids
3. Calls resolveAuction() with the winning bids

```solidity
function resolveAuction(Bid calldata bid1, Bid calldata bid2) external;
```
