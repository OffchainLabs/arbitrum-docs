# Step 5: Sequencer prioritizes the auction contract calls

The sequencer ensures timely processing of auction-related transactions.

1. Auction resolution transactions get priority processing
2. Winner is declared as express lane controller for the round
3. Second-highest bid amount is deducted from winner's balance
4. AuctionResolved event is emitted with the results

```solidity
event AuctionResolved(
    uint256 winningBidAmount,
    uint256 loserBidAmount,
    address indexed winningBidder,
    uint256 indexed winnerRound
);
```
