The Arbitrum Bridge will continue to facilitate transfers of all USDC tokens. When depositing Ethereum-native USDC, the option exists to receive Bridged USDC using Arbitrum's bridge or Arbitrum-native USDC using Circle’s [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol).

## Historical Context

Arbitrum One has supported Bridged USDC since conception, with over a billion Bridged USDC currently in circulation. On June 8th, Circle added support for the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol and launched Arbitrum-native USDC, which enables direct minting and burning of Arbitrum-Native USDC on Arbitrum One. Due to this, the Bridged USDC token symbol was renamed from USDC to USDC.e to accommodate Arbitrum-native USDC. Although most platforms have better support for Bridged USDC, the expectation is that this will change over time. At a later date, there will be incentives implemented to help facilitate the conversion of Bridged USDC to Arbitrum-native USDC.
