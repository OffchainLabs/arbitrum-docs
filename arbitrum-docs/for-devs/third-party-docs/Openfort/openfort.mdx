## How to implement a gasless transaction on Arbitrum using Openfort

With Openfort, you can sponsor transactions for your users, meaning that in-game wallets don't need native tokens to execute transactions, such as minting an NFT. This guide will walk you through the process of implementing a gasless transaction to mint an NFT on Arbitrum.

### 1. Import the NFT Contract

First, you need to import the smart contract you'll be interacting with. In this case, we'll use an NFT contract with a 'mint' function.

```bash
curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/contracts \
  -u "$YOUR_SECRET_KEY:" \
  -d 'name=NFT Contract' \
  -d 'chainId=42161' \
  -d 'address=YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
```

Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of your NFT contract on Arbitrum.

### 2. Set up the Gas Policy

Create a new policy to sponsor gas fees for users:

```shell
curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/policies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -d chainId=42161 \
  -d name="Arbitrum NFT Sponsor" \
  -d "strategy[sponsorSchema]=pay_for_user"
```

Then, add a policy rule for the NFT contract:

```shell
curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/policies/:id/policy_rules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -d type="contract_functions" \
  -d functionName="mint" \
  -d contract="con_..."
```

Replace `:id` with the policy ID returned from the previous step, and `con_...` with your contract ID.

### 3. Create a gasless transaction

Now, let's create a transaction to mint an NFT without the user paying for gas:

```javascript
const Openfort = require('@openfort/openfort-node').default;
const openfort = new Openfort(YOUR_SECRET_KEY);

const policyId = 'pol_...'; // Your policy ID from step 2

const transactionIntent = await openfort.transactionIntents.create({
  chainId: 42161, // Arbitrum One
  policy: policyId,
  optimistic: true,
  interactions: {
    contract: 'con_....', // Your NFT contract ID
    functionName: 'mint',
    functionArgs: ['0x...'], // Address to receive the NFT
  },
});
```

### 4. Optional: specify the player

If you want to associate the transaction with a specific player:

```javascript
const Openfort = require('@openfort/openfort-node').default;
const openfort = new Openfort(YOUR_SECRET_KEY);

const playerId = 'pla_...'; // Your player ID
const policyId = 'pol_...'; // Your policy ID from step 2

const transactionIntent = await openfort.transactionIntents.create({
  player: playerId,
  chainId: 42161, // Arbitrum One
  policy: policyId,
  optimistic: true,
  interactions: {
    contract: 'con_....', // Your NFT contract ID
    functionName: 'mint',
    functionArgs: [playerId], // Minting to the player's address
  },
});
```

By following these steps, you've created a gasless transaction on Arbitrum using Openfort. The user can now mint an NFT without needing to hold ETH for gas fees. Remember to handle the response from the `transactionIntents.create` call in your application to provide feedback to the user about the minting process.
