[Flair](https://flair.dev), Real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

Flair offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

## Why Flair?

Compared to other alternatives the main reasons are:

- üöÄ Adopting **parallel and distributed processing** paradigm means high scalability and resiliency for your indexing stack. Instead of constrained sequential processing (e.g Subgraph).
- üß© Focused on **primitives**, which means on the left you plug-in an RPC and on the right you output the data to any destination database.
- üöÑ Native **real-time stream processing** for certain data workload (such as aggregations, rollups) for things like total volume per pool, or total portfolio per user wallet.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Managed** cloud services avoid DevOps and irrelevant engineering costs for dApp developers.
- üßë‚Äçüíª Avoid decentralization **overhead** (consensus, network hops, etc) since we believe to enable best UX for dApps reading data must be as close to the developers as possible.

### Features

- ‚úÖ Listen to **any EVM chain** with just an RPC URL.
  - Free managed RPC URLs for +8 popular chains already included.
  - Works with both websocket and https-only RPCs.
- ‚úÖ Track and ingest **any contract** for **any event topic.**
  - Auto-track new contracts deployed from factory contracts.
- ‚úÖ **Custom processor scripts** with Javascript runtime (with **Typescript** support)
  - Make external API or Webhook calls to third-party or your backend.
  - Get current or historical USD value of any ERC20 token amount of any contract address on any chain.
  - Use any external NPM library.
- ‚úÖ **Stream** any stored data to your destination database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Timescale, etc).

## Getting Started

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate.git
# ... follow instructions in README.md
```

:::info

Boilerplate instructions will create a **new cluster**, generate **an API Key**, and set up a manifest.yml to index your **first contract** with **sample custom processor** scripts.

Learn more about the [structure of manifest.yml](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/manifest.yml).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Arbitrum RPC nodes

Set a unique namespace, Arbitrum chainId and RPC endpoint in your config. Remember that you can add up to 10 RPC endpoints for resiliency.

```yaml
{
  'cluster': 'dev',
  'namespace': 'my-awesome-arbitrum-indexing-dev',
  'indexers':
    [
      {
        'chainId': 42161,
        'enabled': true,
        'ingestionFilterGroup': 'default',
        'processingFilterGroup': 'default',
        'sources': [
            # Highly-recommended to have at least 1 websocket endpoint
            'wss://arbitrum-one.publicnode.com',
            # You can put multiple endpoints for failover
            'https://arbitrum.llamarpc.com',
          ],
      },
    ],
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sync some historical data using [backfill command](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/backfilling). Remember that `enabled: true` flag in your `config` enabled your indexer to capture data in real-time already.

```bash
# backfill certain contracts or block ranges
pnpm flair backfill --chain 42161 --address
0x22dc069183f85a8473553e32b59efc9fec506baf -d backward --max-blocks 10000
# backfill for a specific block number, if you have certain events you wanna test with
pnpm flair backfill --chain 42161 -b 132763420
# backfill for the recent data in the last X minute
pnpm flair backfill --chain 42161 --min-timestamp="30 mins ago" -d backward
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ [Query](https://docs.flair.dev/#getting-started) your custom indexed data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Stream the data to your [own database](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/database#your-own-database).
