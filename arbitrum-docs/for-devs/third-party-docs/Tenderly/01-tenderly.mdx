## How to use Tenderly

Web3 teams can use Tenderly’s infrastructure and tools to build and scale secure and high-quality Web3 software faster and more efficiently.

Here are some of the ways you can use Tenderly

- **Test and stage contracts and dapps**: Use [Virtual TestNets](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) in CI/CD pipelines to deploy, test, and stage smart contracts in mainnet-like development environments, eliminating the need for local setups.
- **Optimize smart contracts**: Debug and optimize transaction inputs using [Simulator](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulator-ui?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) and [Debugger](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum), reducing debugging time from hours to minutes with visual transaction trace inspection.
- **Predict transaction outcomes**: Integrate [Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) to simulate transaction execution and gas costs, preventing errors and optimizing token transfers before submitting transactions on-chain.
- **Automate security responses**: Implement automated responses to on-chain events and protocol issues using real-time [Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) and [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) to safeguard your dapps and protocols.
- **Ensure high-performance dapp connectivity**: Use [Node RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/node?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) to guarantee low-latency, high-reliability, and multi-region access for your dapp, ensuring smooth operation even during high traffic volumes and spikes.
