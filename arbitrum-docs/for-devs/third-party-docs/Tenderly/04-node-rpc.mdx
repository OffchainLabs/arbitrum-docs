- **Use `tenderly_` RPC methods** for simulations, 100% accurate gas estimation, tracing, and more directly from your dapps.
- **Integrate [`tenderly_gasPrice`](https://docs.tenderly.co/node/rpc-reference/ethereum-mainnet/tenderly_gasPrice?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum)** to get prediction of gas price for the next block, at 3 likelihood levels for transaction inclusion.
- **Build custom RPC methods** that encapsulate unique dapp logic via Node Extensions.
- **Request multi-region support** and region-specific setup.
