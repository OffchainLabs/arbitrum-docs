### Transaction execution prediction

Provide users with accurate predictions and insights to enhance user experience, prevent costly mistakes, and avoid potential security risks.

- [**Simulation RPC**](http://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Integrate Simulation RPC to inform users about transaction outcomes before they sign and send them to the chain.
- [**Token transfers**](http://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/asset-balance-changes?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Use simulation predictions with varying inputs and other strategies to optimize token transfers.
- [**Gas Estimations**](http://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/gas-estimation?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Get 100% correct gas estimations for optimizing gas spending.
- [**Bundle Simulations**](http://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/bundled-simulations?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum) and [**Bundle Gas Predictions**](http://docs.tenderly.co/node/rpc-reference/ethereum-mainnet/tenderly_estimateGasBundle?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Predict the execution of interconnected, bundled simulations for further optimizations.

### Staging

Create a reliable staging environment that mirrors mainnet conditions for thorough testing and collaborative development.

- [**Virtual TestNet API**](https://docs.tenderly.co/reference/api#/operations/createVnet?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Use the API to create and manage Virtual TestNets within your Continuous Integration setup.
- [**Github Actions**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/ci-cd/github-actions-foundry#ci-cd-integration?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Integrate with Github Actions workflows to use Virtual TestNets as contract deployment and staging infrastructure.
- [**Public Block Explorer**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/testnet-explorer?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Expose public explorer to testers while controlling the visibility of your contracts' interfaces and source code.
- [**Assets for testing**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/unlimited-faucet?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Provide any amount of assets for testing using an unlimited faucet for native and ERC-20 tokens, available via RPC methods on Virtual TestNets.

### Protocol upgrading

Bullet-proof upgrades by testing post-update behavior before deployment, whether it's a proxy upgrade, multisig transaction execution, or any other form of protocol upgrade.

- [**Multisig transactions**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/protocol-upgrades?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Dissect multisig transactions on a Virtual TestNet, by approving and executing queued transactions.
- [**DAO proposals**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/dao-proposals?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Validate DAO proposals in a realistic environment by staging on an isolated Virtual TestNet synced with mainnet data.
- [**Protocol updates**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/protocol-upgrades?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Validate protocol updates by staging them on a Virtual TestNet, using Simulator UI and Debugger to execute and analyze transactions in a safe environment.
- [**Proxy upgrades**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/proxy-upgrades?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrum): Perform security checks of proxy contract upgrades using Virtual TestNets, Simulator UI, and Debugger.
