In this page, we describe some of the popular development frameworks that exist in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It’s worth noting that, because Arbitrum chains are EVM compatible, most of the tools that are used to develop on Ethereum, can also be used to develop on Arbitrum.

## Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a comprehensive development environment designed specifically for Ethereum, Arbitrum and, in general, EVM developers. It streamlines the process of creating, compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts. By providing a robust and customizable framework, Hardhat makes it easy to manage complex projects and integrate with other tools in the ecosystem. Its features include a built-in console, advanced debugging capabilities, and support for extending functionality through plugins, allowing developers to create efficient and secure decentralized applications.

## Foundry

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a high-performance, portable, and modular toolkit designed for EVM application development, leveraging the Rust programming language. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools to streamline the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum, Arbitrum and, in general, any EVM network. Foundry facilitates seamless interaction with EVM smart contracts, transactions, and chain data, while also providing a local node and a user-friendly Solidity REPL environment for efficient development.

## Truffle

[Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) is a comprehensive suite of tools for smart contract development, providing an end-to-end solution for building, testing, debugging, and deploying on Ethereum, Arbitrum and other EVM compatible chains. It features best-in-class debugging, fast EVM simulation with Ganache, a user-centered design with a VS Code extension, and robust L1 & L2 support. Truffle prioritizes security and partners with ConsenSys Diligence to bring continuous security to your projects, ensuring a seamless and secure developer experience.

## Brownie

[Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) is a Python-based framework designed for developing and testing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It offers full support for Solidity and Vyper programming languages and utilizes pytest for contract testing. Brownie also incorporates trace-based coverage evaluation, property-based and stateful testing with Hypothesis, and powerful debugging tools, including python-style tracebacks and custom error strings.
