Token bridging is a fundamental aspect of any Layer 2 (L2) protocol. Arbitrum uses its ability to pass messages between L1 and L2 (see [Cross-chain messaging](/build-decentralized-apps/cross-chain-messaging)) to allow projects to trustlessly move assets from Ethereum to an Arbitrum chain and back. Any asset and asset type can in principle be bridged, including Ether, ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 tokens among others.

This section offers a series of conceptual documents explaining how asset bridging works and what options exist to bridge ether (ETH) and other types of asset between layers, as well as a series of how-tos showcasing the different methods available for making your token bridgeable.

This section is divided in 3 parts:

- [ETH bridging](/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-ether.mdx): explains how Arbitrum handles bridging ETH, the native token of Ethereum and the Arbitrum chains, between L1 and L2.
- [ERC-20 token bridging](/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-erc20.mdx): explains the architecture of the token bridge for this type of asset, describing the different options available to make a token bridgeable.
- [Bridge tokens programmatically](/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-overview.mdx): goes over the process of making an ERC-20 token bridgeable using the different types of gateway available in the token bridge.
