[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is a widely-recognized Web3 services platform that specializes in decentralized oracle networks. It lets you build Ethereum and Arbitrum dApps that connect to a variety of off-chain data feeds and APIs, including those that provide asset prices, weather data, random number generation, and more.

### Querying the price of $ARB through Chainlink

Here’s an example on how to use a price feed from Chainlink to query the current price of $ARB on-chain. We’ll use an interface provided by Chainlink that can be configured with the address of the proxy that holds the information we want to request, and wrap the operation in a contract.

Chainlink provides an npm package with the contracts needed to access their feeds. We first install that package in our project:

```tsx
yarn add @chainlink/contracts
```

To use a data feed, we retrieve the information through the `AggregatorV3Interface` and the proxy address of the feed we want to query.

```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
```

In this case, we want to obtain the current price of $ARB in $USD in Arbitrum One, so we need to know the address of the proxy that will provide that information. Chainlink maintains a list of price feed address [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=arbitrum). For $ARB/$USD, we’ll use the address `0xb2A824043730FE05F3DA2efaFa1CBbe83fa548D6`.

We can now build the function to get the latest price of $ARB. We’ll use this example contract:

```solidity
contract ARBPriceConsumer {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Arbitrum One
     * Aggregator: ARB/USD
     * Address: 0xb2A824043730FE05F3DA2efaFa1CBbe83fa548D6
     */
		address constant PROXY = 0xb2A824043730FE05F3DA2efaFa1CBbe83fa548D6;

    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(PROXY);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price.
     */
    function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (
            /* uint80 roundID */,
            int price,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            /*uint timeStamp*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return price;
    }
}
```

You can adapt this contract to your needs. Just remember to use the address of the asset you want to request the price for in the appropriate network, and to **deploy your contract to the same network**. Remember we have a [Quickstart](/build-decentralized-apps/01-quickstart-solidity-hardhat.mdx) available that goes through the process of compiling and deploying a contract.
