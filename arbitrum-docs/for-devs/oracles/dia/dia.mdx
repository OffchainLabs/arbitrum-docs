[DIA](https://www.diadata.org/) is a cross-chain oracle provider that enhances data transparency, customization, and accessibility. With a novel architecture aggregating raw trade data directly from first-party sources, namely centralized and decentralized exchanges, DIA offers 100% source transparency, bespoke customization, and chain-native asset price feeds.

You can find an example on how to use DIA in your project on this [page](https://docs.diadata.org/introduction/intro-to-dia-oracles/request-an-oracle).

### How to use DIA oracles on Arbitrum

**Requesting a custom oracle**: DIA deploys oracles tailored to each dApp’s needs. Each oracle is customizable, including data sources, cleansing filters, pricing, computational methodologies, update mechanisms, and more. This flexibility ensures that the data and oracle remain robust and resilient to the market conditions and provide a global market price and specific individual or cross-chain market prices.

### Token Price Feeds

DIA token price feeds provide smart contracts with real-time price information for [3,000+ cryptocurrencies](https://diadata.org/app/price), sourced from [80+ trusted, high-volume DEXs and CEXs](https://diadata.org/app/source/defi).

### How to access DIA oracles?

Here is an example of how to access a price value on DIA oracles:

1. Access your custom oracle smart contract on Arbitrum.
2. Call `getValue(pair_name)` with `pair_name` being the full pair name such as `BTC/USD`. You can use the "Read" section on the explorer to execute this call.
3. The response of the call contains two values:

- The current asset price in USD with a fix-comma notation of 8 decimals.
- The UNIX timestamp of the last oracle update.

You can find DIA's oracle integration samples in Solidity and Vyper languages by visiting:

### Arbitrum demo price oracles

DIA has deployed the following demo oracles for the Arbitrum community. It provides a limited selection of cryptocurrency price feeds with predefined configuration settings.

:::note

DIA demo oracles are not intended for use in production environments. Developers can request a dedicated, production-ready oracle with custom price feeds and configuration settings. Start the request process: [Request a Custom Oracle | DIA Documentation](https://docs.diadata.org/introduction/intro-to-dia-oracles/request-an-oracle)
