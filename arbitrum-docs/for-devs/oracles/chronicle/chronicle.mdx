description: Learn how to integrate oracles into your Arbitrum dapp
user_story: As a developer, I want to understand how to use oracles in Arbitrum to get off-chain data onchain.
content_type: how-to
---

[Chronicle Protocol](https://chroniclelabs.org/) is a novel Oracle solution that overcomes the current limitations of transferring data onchain by developing scalable, cost-efficient, decentralized, and verifiable Oracles, rewriting the rulebook on data transparency and accessibility.

### Querying the price of $ARB using Chronicle

Chronicle contracts are read-protected by a whitelist, meaning you won't be able to read them onchain without your address being added to the whitelist. On the Testnet, users can add themselves to the whitelist through the SelfKisser contract; a process playfully referred to as "kissing" themselves. To access production Oracles on the Mainnet, please open a support ticket in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CjgvJ9EspJ) in the 🆘 ｜ support channel.

For the deployment addresses, please check out the [Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracles).
