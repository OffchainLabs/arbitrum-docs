description: Learn how to integrate oracles into your Arbitrum dapp
user_story: As a developer, I want to understand how to use oracles in Arbitrum to get off-chain data on-chain.
content_type: how-to

[Chronicle Protocol](https://chroniclelabs.org/) is a novel Oracle solution that overcomes the current limitations of transferring data on-chain by developing scalable, cost-efficient, decentralized, and verifiable Oracles, rewriting the rulebook on data transparency and accessibility.

### Querying the price of $ARB using Chronicle

Chronicle contracts are read-protected by a whitelist, meaning you won't be able to read them on-chain without your address being added to the whitelist. On the Testnet, users can add themselves to the whitelist through the SelfKisser contract; a process playfully referred to as "kissing" themselves. To access production Oracles on the Mainnet, please open a support ticket in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CjgvJ9EspJ) in the ðŸ†˜ ï½œ support channel.

For the deployment addresses, please check out the [Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracles).
