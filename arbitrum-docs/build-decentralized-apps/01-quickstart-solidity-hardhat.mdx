:::info Want to use Rust instead?

Head over to [the Stylus quickstart](/stylus/quickstart) if you'd like to use Rust instead of Solidity.

:::

This quickstart is for web developers who want to start building **decentralized applications** (dApps) using <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum'>Arbitrum</a>. It makes no assumptions about your prior experience with Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Solidity. Familiarity with Javascript and `yarn` is expected. If you're new to Ethereum, consider studying the [Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) before proceeding.

### What we're building

We're going to build a digital cupcake vending machine using Solidity smart contracts[^1]. This vending machine will follow two rules:

1. The vending machine will distribute a cupcake to anyone who hasn't recently received one.
2. The vending machine's rules can't be changed by anyone.

Here's the vending machine implemented with Javascript.
To use it, enter a name in the form below and press the 'Cupcake please!' button, you should see your cupcake balance go up.

import { VendingMachine } from '@site/src/components/VendingMachine/VendingMachine';

<VendingMachine id="dumb-cupcakes" type="web2" />

Note that although this vending machine appears to follow the rules, it doesn't follow them as much as we'd like. The vending machine's business logic and data are hosted by a **centralized service provider**. We're trusting that this service provider isn't malicious, but:

1. Our centralized service provider can deny access to particular users.
2. A malicious actor can change the rules of the vending machine at any time, for example, to give their friends extra cupcakes.

Centralized third-party intermediaries represent a **single point of failure** that malicious actors may become incentivized to exploit. To mitigate this type of risk, we can decentralize our vending machine's **business logic and data**, rendering this type of exploitation infeasible.

This is Arbitrum's core value proposition to you, dear developer. Arbitrum makes it easy for you to deploy your vending machines to Ethereum's permissionless, <a data-quicklook-from='trustless'>trustless</a>, _decentralized_ network of nodes[^2] while keeping costs low for you and your users.

Let's implement the "Web3" version of the above vending machine using Arbitrum.

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Web3 wallet</summary>

The <a data-quicklook-from='ethereum-wallet'>wallet</a> we'll use to interact with our vending machine. See [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) and click View MetaMask Web or [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/web3) and click Connect Wallet to install.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Yarn</summary>

Yarn is the package manager we'll use to install our dependencies. See [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install.

We'll address remaining dependencies as we go.

### Ethereum and Arbitrum in a nutshell

- **Ethereum**
  - Ethereum is a decentralized network of <a href='https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/concepts/nodes-networks'>nodes</a> that use Ethereum's client software (like Offchain's <a href='https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/getting-started'>Prysm</a>) to maintain a public <a data-quicklook-from='blockchain'>blockchain</a> data structure.
  - The data within Ethereum's blockchain data structure changes one transaction at a time.
  - <a data-quicklook-from="smart-contract">Smart contracts</a> are small programs that execute transactions
    according to predefined rules. Ethereum's nodes host and execute smart contracts.
  - You can use smart contracts to build decentralized apps (dApps) that use Ethereum's network to process transactions and store data.
  - DApps let users carry their data and identity between applications without having to trust centralized service providers.
  - People who run Ethereum validator nodes[^3] can earn `$ETH` for processing and validating transactions on behalf of users and dApps.
  - These transactions can be expensive when the network is under heavy load.
- **Arbitrum**
  - Arbitrum is a suite of L2 scaling solutions for dApp developers.
  - <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> is an L2 chain that implements the
    <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-rollup-protocol">Arbitrum Rollup protocol</a>.
  - You can use Arbitrum One to build user-friendly dApps with high throughput, low latency, and low transaction costs while inheriting Ethereum's high security standards[^4].

Let's review our vending machine's Javascript implementation, convert it into a Solidity smart contract, then deploy it to Arbitrum One.

We'll ask your smart contract for cupcakes using the vending machines on this page.

### Review the Javascript vending machine

Here's the vending machine implemented as a Javascript class:

```js title="VendingMachine.js"
class VendingMachine {
  // state variables = internal memory of the vending machine
  cupcakeBalances = {};
  cupcakeDistributionTimes = {};

  // Vend a cupcake to the caller
  giveCupcakeTo(userId) {
    if (this.cupcakeDistributionTimes[userId] === undefined) {
      this.cupcakeBalances[userId] = 0;
      this.cupcakeDistributionTimes[userId] = 0;
    }

    // Rule 1: The vending machine will distribute a cupcake to anyone who hasn't recently received one.
    const fiveSeconds = 5000;
    const userCanReceiveCupcake = this.cupcakeDistributionTimes[userId] + fiveSeconds <= Date.now();
    if (userCanReceiveCupcake) {
      this.cupcakeBalances[userId]++;
      this.cupcakeDistributionTimes[userId] = Date.now();
      console.log(`Enjoy your cupcake, ${userId}!`);
      return true;
    } else {
      console.error(
        'HTTP 429: Too Many Cupcakes (you must wait at least 5 seconds between cupcakes)',
      );
      return false;
    }
  }

  getCupcakeBalanceFor(userId) {
    return this.cupcakeBalances[userId];
  }
}
```

The `VendingMachine` class uses _state variables_ and _functions_ to implement _predefined rules_. This implementation is useful because it automates cupcake distribution, but there's a problem: it's hosted by a centralized server controlled by a third-party service provider.

Let's decentralize our vending machine's business logic and data by porting the above Javascript implementation into a Solidity smart contract.

### Review the Solidity vending machine

Here is a Solidity implementation of the vending machine.
Solidity is a language that compiles to [EVM bytecode](https://blog.chain.link/what-are-abi-and-bytecode-in-solidity/). This means that it can be deployed to any Ethereum-compatible blockchain, including Ethereum mainnet, <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-one'>Arbitrum One</a>, and <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-nova'>Arbitrum Nova</a>.

```solidity title="VendingMachine.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Specify the Solidity compiler version - this contract requires version 0.8.9 or higher
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

// Define a smart contract named VendingMachine
// Unlike regular classes, once deployed, this contract's code cannot be modified
// This ensures that the vending machine's rules remain constant and trustworthy
contract VendingMachine {
    // State variables are permanently stored in blockchain storage
    // These mappings associate Ethereum addresses with unsigned integers
    // The 'private' keyword means these variables can only be accessed from within this contract
    mapping(address => uint) private _cupcakeBalances;     // Tracks how many cupcakes each address owns
    mapping(address => uint) private _cupcakeDistributionTimes;  // Tracks when each address last received a cupcake

    // Function to give a cupcake to a specified address
    // 'public' means this function can be called by anyone
    // 'returns (bool)' specifies that the function returns a boolean value
    function giveCupcakeTo(address userAddress) public returns (bool) {
        // Initialize first-time users
        // In Solidity, uninitialized values default to 0, so this check isn't strictly necessary
        // but is included to mirror the JavaScript implementation
        if (_cupcakeDistributionTimes[userAddress] == 0) {
            _cupcakeBalances[userAddress] = 0;
            _cupcakeDistributionTimes[userAddress] = 0;
        }

        // Calculate when the user is eligible for their next cupcake
        // 'seconds' is a built-in time unit in Solidity
        // 'block.timestamp' gives us the current time in seconds since Unix epoch
        uint fiveSecondsFromLastDistribution = _cupcakeDistributionTimes[userAddress] + 5 seconds;
        bool userCanReceiveCupcake = fiveSecondsFromLastDistribution <= block.timestamp;

        if (userCanReceiveCupcake) {
            // If enough time has passed, give them a cupcake and update their last distribution time
            _cupcakeBalances[userAddress]++;
            _cupcakeDistributionTimes[userAddress] = block.timestamp;
            return true;
        } else {
            // If not enough time has passed, revert the transaction with an error message
            // 'revert' cancels the transaction and returns the error message to the user
            revert("HTTP 429: Too Many Cupcakes (you must wait at least 5 seconds between cupcakes)");
        }
    }

    // Function to check how many cupcakes an address owns
    // 'public' means anyone can call this function
    // 'view' means this function only reads data and doesn't modify state
    // This makes it free to call (no gas cost) when called externally
    function getCupcakeBalanceFor(address userAddress) public view returns (uint) {
        return _cupcakeBalances[userAddress];
    }
}
```

### Compile your smart contract with Remix

Smart contracts need to be compiled to bytecode in order to be stored and executed on-chain by the EVM, we'll be using Remix to do that.

Remix is a browser-based IDE for EVM development. There are other IDEs to choose from (Foundry, Hardhat) but Remix doesn't require any local environment setup, that's why we'll choose it for this tutorial.

Let's first add our smart contract to Remix following these steps:

1. Load Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org

2. Create a blank workspace in Remix:

<details>
<summary>File explorer > Workspaces > Create blank</summary>

![](./images/remix-create-blank-project-2025-01-07.gif)

</details>

3. Copy your vending machine contract

4. Paste your contract in Remix

<details>
<summary>File explorer > New file</summary>

![](./images/remix-paste-vending-machine-contract-2025-01-07.gif)

</details>

5. Compile your contract in Remix

<details>
<summary>Select contract > Click "compile" menu > Hit "compile" icon</summary>

![](./images/remix-compile-contract-2025-01-07.gif)

</details>

#### Configure Metamask

Next, open Metamask and create or import a wallet by following the displayed instructions. By default, Metamask will connect to Ethereum mainnet. To connect to our local "testnet", enable test networks for Metamask by clicking `Show/hide test networks` from the network selector dropdown. Then select the `Localhost 8545` network:

![Connect Metamask to Localhost 8545](./images/quickstart-localhost-metamask.png)

<!-- Note that if you'd like to host your local testnet on a different port, you can do so by running `yarn hardhat node --port 8546` instead. You'll then need to configure a `Localhost 8546` network in Metamask. -->

Your mainnet wallet won't have a balance on your local testnet's node, but we can import one of the test accounts into Metamask to gain access to 10,000 fake ETH. Copy the private key of one of the test accounts (it works with or without the `0x` prefix, so e.g. `0xac0..f80` or `ac0..f80`) and import it into Metamask:

![Connect Metamask to Localhost 8545](./images/quickstart-import-metamask.png)

You should see a balance of 10,000 ETH. Keep your private key handy; we'll use it again in a moment.

Next, click Metamask's network selector dropdown, and then click the `Add Network` button. Click "Add a network manually" and then provide the following information:

- Network Name: `Arbitrum Sepolia`
- New RPC URL: `https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc`
- Chain ID: `421614`
- Currency Symbol: `ASPL`

As we interact with the cupcake vending machine, we'll use Metamask's network selector dropdown to determine which network our cupcake transactions are sent to. For now, we'll leave the network set to `Localhost 8545`.

#### Deploy the smart contract to your local testnet

From another terminal instance, run `yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers hardhat-deploy hardhat-deploy-ethers` to install additional dependencies needed for contract deployment. Then run `yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`. This command will deploy your smart contract to the local testnet's node. You should see something like `Cupcake vending machine deployed to 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512` in your terminal. `0xe7...512` is the address of your smart contract in your local testnet.

<!-- // footnote about how addresses live in the "global state" of the network, which is mirrored across all nodes -->

<!-- Ensure that the `Localhost` network is selected within Metamask. Then copy and paste your **contract address** below and click `Get cupcake!`. You should be prompted to sign a transaction that gives you a cupcake. -->

<!-- <VendingMachine id="smart-local-cupcakes" type="web3-localhost" /> -->

### What's going on here?

Our first `VendingMachine` is labeled `WEB2` because it demonstrates traditional n-tier web application architecture:

![Architecture diagram](./images/quickstart-vending-machine-architecture.png)

The `WEB3-LOCALHOST` architecture is similar to the `WEB2` architecture, with one key difference: with the `WEB3` version, **the business logic and data live in an (emulated for now) decentralized network of nodes** instead of a centralized network of servers.

Let's take a closer look at the differences between our `VendingMachine` implementations:

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Next, we'll deploy our smart contract to a network of real nodes: Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet.

### Deploy the smart contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet

We were able to deploy to a local testnet for free because we were using [Hardhat's built-in Ethereum network emulator](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview#hardhat-network). Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet is powered by a real network of real nodes, so we'll need to pay a small transaction fee to deploy our smart contract. This fee can be paid with the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet's token, $ASPL.

<!-- todo: partialize this - duplicated in Orbit quickstart -->

:::info $ASPL IS SHORTHAND

"$ASPL" isn't a canonical term. It's just shorthand for "Arbitrum Sepolia testnet $ETH" that we use for convenience.

:::

First, update the `hardhat.config.js` file to specify the private key of the test account that you'll use to deploy your smart contract (and pay the transaction fee):

```javascript title="hardhat.config.js"
// ...
const SEPOLIA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY = ''; // <- this should **not** begin with "0x"
// ...
accounts: [SEPOLIA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY]; // <- uncomment this line
// ...
```

:::caution

Note that we're adding a private key to a config file. This is **not** a best practice; we're doing it here for convenience. Consider using environment variables when working on a real project.

:::

<!-- todo: partialize this - duplicated in Orbit quickstart -->

Next, let's deposit some $ASPL into the wallet corresponding to the private key we added to `hardhat.config.js`. At the time of this quickstart's writing, the easiest way to acquire $ASPL is to bridge Sepolia $ETH from Ethereum's L1 Sepolia network to Arbitrum's L2 Sepolia network:

1. Use an L1 Sepolia $ETH faucet like [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to acquire some testnet $ETH on L1 Sepolia.
2. Bridge your L1 Sepolia $ETH into Arbitrum L2 using [the Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

Once you've acquired some $ASPL, you'll be able to deploy your smart contract to Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet by issuing the following command:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network arbitrumSepolia
```

This tells hardhat to deploy the compiled smart contract through the RPC endpoint corresponding to `arbitrumSepolia` in `hardhat.config.js`. You should see the following output:

```bash
Cupcake vending machine deployed to 0xff825139321bd8fB8b720BfFC5b9EfDB7d6e9AB3
```

Congratulations! You've just deployed **business logic and data** to Arbitrum Sepolia. This logic and data will be hashed and submitted within a transaction to Ethereum's L1 Sepolia network, and then it will be mirrored across all nodes in the Sepolia network[^6].

To view your smart contract in a blockchain explorer, visit `https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x...B3`, but replace the `0x...B3` part of the URL with the full address of your deployed smart contract.

Select `Arbitrum Sepolia` from Metamask's dropdown, paste your contract address into the `VendingMachine` below, and click `Get cupcake!`. You should be prompted to sign a transaction that gives you a cupcake.

<VendingMachine id="smart-sepolia-cupcakes" type="web3-arb-sepolia" />

### Deploy the smart contract to Arbitrum One Mainnet

Now that we've verified that our smart contract works on Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet, we're ready to deploy it to Arbitrum One Mainnet. This is the same process as deploying to Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet, except that we'll need to pay a transaction fee in real $ETH instead of $ASPL.

Expect to see inconsistent $ETH gas fees in this step - the [Gas and fees section](/how-arbitrum-works/09-gas-fees.mdx) contains more information about how gas fees are determined for Arbitrum transactions.

<!-- not sure if this is the best way to work through this step - optimized for quick, assumed user knows how to create a deployment account; or otherwise will be ok with having to ask chatgpt -->

First, update the `hardhat.config.js` file to specify the private key of the **one-time-use deployment account** that you'll use to deploy your smart contract (and pay the transaction fee):

```javascript title="hardhat.config.js"
// ...
const ARBITRUM_MAINNET_TEMPORARY_PRIVATE_KEY = ''; // <- this should **not** begin with "0x"
// ...
accounts: [ARBITRUM_MAINNET_TEMPORARY_PRIVATE_KEY]; // <- uncomment this line
// ...
```

:::caution

Note that we're adding a private key to a config file. This is **not** a best practice. Consider using environment variables instead.

:::

Next, deposit some $ETH into the wallet corresponding to the private key we added to `hardhat.config.js`. You'll then be able to deploy your smart contract to Arbitrum One Mainnet by issuing the following command:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network arbitrumOne
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Cupcake vending machine deployed to 0xff825139321bd8fB8b720BfFC5b9EfDB7d6e9AB3
```

Congratulations! You've just deployed **business logic and data** to Ethereum's decentralized network of nodes by way of Arbitrum One[^2].

To view your smart contract in a blockchain explorer, visit `https://arbiscan.io/address/0x...B3`, but replace the `0x...B3` part of the URL with the full address of your deployed smart contract.

Select `Arbitrum One` from Metamask's dropdown, paste your contract address into the `VendingMachine` below, and click `Get cupcake!`. You should be prompted to sign a transaction that gives you an immutable cupcake.

<VendingMachine id="smart-mainnet-cupcakes" type="web3-arb-one" />

### Summary

In this quickstart, we:

- Identified **two business rules**: 1) fair and permissionless cupcake distribution, 2) immutable business logic and data.
- Identified a **challenge**: These rules are difficult to follow in a centralized application.
- Identified a **solution**: Arbitrum makes it easy for developers to decentralize business logic and data (using Ethereum mainnet as a settlement layer).
- Converted a vending machine's Javascript business logic into a **Solidity smart contract**.
- **Deployed our smart contract** to Hardhat's local development network, and then Arbitrum's Sepolia testnet, and then Arbitrum One Mainnet.

[^1]: The vending machine example was inspired by [Ethereum.org's "Introduction to Smart Contracts"](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), which was inspired by [Nick Szabo's "From vending machines to smart contracts"](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/12/from-vending-machines-to-smart.html).
[^2]: Although application front-ends are usually hosted by centralized services, smart contracts allow the underlying logic and data to be partially or fully decentralized. These smart contracts are hosted and executed by Ethereum's public, decentralized network of nodes. Arbitrum has its own network of nodes that use advanced cryptography techniques to "batch process" Ethereum transactions and then submit them to Ethereum L1, which significantly reduces the cost of using Ethereum. All without requiring developers to compromise on security or decentralization.
[^3]: There are multiple types of Ethereum nodes. The ones that earn ETH for processing and validating transactions are called _validators_. See [Nodes and Networks](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/concepts/nodes-networks) for a beginner-friendly introduction to Ethereum's node types.
[^4]: When our `VendingMachine` contract is deployed to Ethereum, it'll be hosted by Ethereum's decentralized network of nodes. Generally speaking, we won't be able to modify the contract's code after it's deployed.
