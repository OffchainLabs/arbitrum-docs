Ether (`ETH`) is the native currency of Ethereum and all Arbitrum chains. It is used to pay the necessary fees to execute a transaction in those chains. Bridging `ETH` from Ethereum (parent chain) to an Arbitrum chain (child chain) follows, thus, a different process than the one followed when bridging other types of asset.

## Depositing ether

To move `ETH` from the parent chain to the child chain, you execute a deposit transaction via `Inbox.depositEth`. This transfers funds to the Bridge contract on the parent chain and credits the same funds to you inside the Arbitrum chain at the specified address.

```sol
function depositEth(address destAddr) external payable override returns (uint256)
```

:::warning

If the transaction is sent by a `7702-enabled account`, the destination address on L2 is subject to address aliasing. The `ETH` will be credited to the aliased address of the sender, not the raw `msg.sender`. See [address aliasing](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) for details.

The following diagram depicts the process that funds follow during a deposit operation.

As far as the parent chain is concerned, all deposited funds are held by the Arbitrum Bridge contract. Once finalized, the `ETH` becomes available on the L2 at the aliased or specified address, depending on the sender type.

## Withdrawing ether

Withdrawing ether can be done using the [`ArbSys` precompile](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbsys)'s `withdrawEth` method:

```sol
ArbSys(100).withdrawEth{ value: 2300000 }(destAddress)
```

Upon withdrawing, the Ether balance is burnt on the Arbitrum side, and will later be made available on the Ethereum side.

`ArbSys.withdrawEth` is a convenience function equivalent to calling `ArbSys.sendTxToL1` with empty `calldataForL1`. Like any other `sendTxToL1` call, it will require an additional call to `Outbox.executeTransaction` on the parent chain after the dispute period elapses for the user to finalize claiming their funds on the parent chain (see [Child to parent chain messaging](/how-arbitrum-works/11-l2-to-l1-messaging.mdx)). Once the withdrawal is executed from the Outbox, the user's `ETH` balance will be credited on the parent chain.

The following diagram depicts the process that funds follow during a withdraw operation.
