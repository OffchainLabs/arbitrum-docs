| Chainlink | Chainlink is a widely-recognized Web3 services platform specializing in decentralized oracle networks. It enables building Ethereum and Arbitrum dApps that connect to a variety of off-chain data feeds and APIs, including asset prices, weather data, random number generation, and more. | [How to use Chainlink](/build-decentralized-apps/oracles/02-how-to-use-oracles.mdx#chainlink) |
| API3      | API3 is a collaborative project delivering traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It offers technology for Airnodes to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts, and the data can be queried directly through Airnodes or dAPIs.  | [How to use API3](/build-decentralized-apps/oracles/02-how-to-use-oracles.mdx#api3)           |
| Tellor    | Tellor is a decentralized oracle network that incentivizes data reporting and validation. It supports a range of data types, including basic spot prices, sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), Snapshot Vote Results, and custom data needs.                                             | [How to use Tellor](/build-decentralized-apps/oracles/02-how-to-use-oracles.mdx#tellor)       |
| Supra     | Supra is an Oracle & IntraLayer offering a toolkit of cross-chain solutions such as data oracles, asset bridges, and automation networks. It aims to interlink all blockchains, whether public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises).                                                       | [Supra Overview](https://supraoracles.com/docs/overview/)                                     |
