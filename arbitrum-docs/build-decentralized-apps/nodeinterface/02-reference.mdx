The Arbitrum Nitro software includes a special `NodeInterface` contract available at address `0xc8` that is only accessible via RPCs (it's not actually deployed on-chain, and thus can't be called by smart contracts). This reference page documents the specific calls available in the NodeInterface. For a more conceptual description of what it is and how it works, please refer to the [NodeInterface conceptual page](/build-decentralized-apps/nodeinterface/01-overview.mdx).

## NodeInterface methods

import NodeInterfaceRef from '../../for-devs/dev-tools-and-resources/partials/precompile-tables/_NodeInterface.md';
