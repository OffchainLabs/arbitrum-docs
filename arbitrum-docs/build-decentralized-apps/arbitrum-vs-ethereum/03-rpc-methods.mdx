Although the majority of RPC methods follow the same behavior as in Ethereum, some methods might produce a different result, or add more information, when used on an Arbitrum chain. This page covers the differences in response body fields you'll find when calling RPC methods on an Arbitrum chain vs on Ethereum.

:::info

Comprehensive documentation on all generally available JSON-RPC methods for Ethereum [can be found at ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/). As Arbitrum has `go-ethereum` at its core, most of the documented methods there can be used with no modifications.

## Transactions

When calling [`eth_getTransactionByHash`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash) and other methods that return a transaction, Arbitrum includes a few additional fields and leverages some existing fields in different ways than Ethereum.

### Transaction types

In addition to the [three transaction types](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) currently supported on Ethereum, Arbitrum adds additional types listed below and [documented in full detail here](/how-arbitrum-works/04-geth-at-the-core.mdx#transaction-types).

On RPC calls that return transactions, the `type` field will reflect the custom codes where applicable.

| Transaction type code | Transaction type name           | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| `101`                 | `ArbitrumUnsignedTxType`        | Used to call an L2 contract from L1, originated by a user through the Arbitrum bridge                                                                           |
| `102`                 | `ArbitrumContractTxType`        | Used to call an L2 contract from L1, originated by a contract through the Arbitrum bridge                                                                       |
| `104`                 | `ArbitrumRetryTxType`           | Used to [manually redeem a retryable ticket](/how-arbitrum-works/10-l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx) on L2 that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas) |
| `105`                 | `ArbitrumSubmitRetryableTxType` | Used to [submit a retryable ticket](/how-arbitrum-works/10-l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx#submission) via the Arbitrum bridge on L1                                     |
| `106`                 | `ArbitrumInternalTxType`        | Internal transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like the L1 base fee and the block number                                          |

### Additional fields

On RPC calls that return transactions, the following fields are added to the returned object.

| Field name  | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requestId` | On L1 to L2 transactions, this field is added to indicate position in the Inbox queue |

### Existing fields with different behavior

On RPC calls that return transactions, the following fields will have a different content than what's received on Ethereum.

| Field name | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `from`     | On L1 to L2 transactions, this field will contain the [_aliased_ version](/how-arbitrum-works/10-l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx#address-aliasing) of the L1's `msg.sender` |

## Transaction receipts

When calling [`eth_getTransactionReceipt`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionreceipt), Arbitrum includes a few additional fields and leverages some existing fields in different ways than Ethereum.

### Additional fields

On RPC calls that return transaction receipts, the following fields are added to the returned object.

| `gasUsedForL1`  | Amount of gas spent on L1 calldata in units of L2 gas. More information in [Gas and fees](/how-arbitrum-works/09-gas-fees.mdx)                                                              |

## Blocks

When calling [`eth_getBlockByHash`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbyhash) and other methods that return a block, Arbitrum includes a few additional fields and leverages some existing fields in different ways than Ethereum.

### Additional fields

On RPC calls that return a block, the following fields are added to the returned object.

| Field name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Existing fields with different behavior

On RPC calls that return a block, the following fields will have a different content than what's received on Ethereum.

| Field name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extraData`  | This field is equivalent to `sendRoot`                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `mixHash`    | First 8 bytes is equivalent to `sendCount`, second 8 bytes is equivalent to `l1BlockNumber`                                                                                                                                              |
| `difficulty` | Fixed at `0x1`                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `gasLimit`   | Value is fixed at `0x4000000000000`, but it's important to note that Arbitrum One currently has a 32M gas limit per block. See [Chain params](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/03-chain-params.mdx) for the gas limit of other chains |

## Other methods that are slightly different

### `eth_syncing`

Calling `eth_syncing` returns false when the node is fully synced (just like on Ethereum). If the node is still syncing, `eth_syncing` returns an object with data about the synchronization status. Here, we provide more details.

#### Understanding messages, batches, and blocks

Nitro nodes receive transactions from their parent chain and the sequencer feed in the form of messages. These messages may contain multiple transactions that are executed by the node, which then produces blocks. Each message produces exactly one block. In most Nitro chains, the message number and the block number are the same. However, Arbitrum One has pre-Nitro (classic) blocks, so for that chain, message 0 produced block `22207818` (blocks prior to that one are 'classic' blocks). Keep in mind that the offset between message and block number is constant in the chain.

On the parent chain, messages appear in batches. The number of messages per batch changes between batches.

#### Custom `eth_syncing` fields

:::info

Note that the exact output for the `eth_syncing` RPC call of an out-of-sync Nitro node is not considered a stable API. It is still being actively developed and can be modified without notice between versions.

:::

| Field name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `batchSeen`                    | Last batch number observed on the parent chain                                                                                                                                           |
| `batchProcessed`               | Last batch that was processed on the parent chain. Processing means dividing the batch into messages                                                                                     |
| `messageOfProcessedBatch`      | Last message in the last processed batch                                                                                                                                                 |
| `msgCount`                     | Number of messages known/queued by the Nitro node                                                                                                                                        |
| `blockNum`                     | Last block created by the Nitro node (up-to-date L2 block the node is synced to)                                                                                                         |
| `messageOfLastBlock`           | Message that was used to produce the block above                                                                                                                                         |
| `broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos` | If different than 0, this is expected to be greater than `msgCount`. This field notes a message that was read from the feed but not processed because earlier messages are still missing |
| `lastL1BlockNum`               | Last block number from the parent chain that Nitro sees. This is used to debug the connection with the parent chain                                                                      |
| `lastl1BlockHash`              | Last block hash from the parent chain that Nitro sees. This is used to debug the connection with the parent chain                                                                        |

:::info

Note that if the sync process encounters an error while trying to collect the data above (not expected) this error will be added to the response.

:::

#### Understanding common scenarios

- If `batchSeen` > `batchProcessed`, some batches have still not been processed
- If `msgCount` > `messageOfLastBlock`, some messages have been processed, but not all relevant blocks have been built (this is usually the longest stage while syncing a new node)
- If `broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos` > `msgCount`, the feed is ahead of the last message known to the node

### `debug_traceTransaction`

The Nitro node provides a native tracer for debugging Stylus contracts called `stylusTracer`, which returns a JSON array with objects containing the metadata for each executed HostIO.
HostIOs are calls the WasmVM makes to read and write data in the EVM.
With the result of this tracer and the code for the Stylus contract, you have all the data to understand what happened in a Stylus transaction.

:::info

The `cargo-stylus` command-line tool uses the `stylusTracer` to replay transactions locally inside a debugger.
More information can be found on [How to debug Stylus transactions using Cargo Stylus Replay](/stylus/how-tos/debugging-stylus-tx).

:::

The table below describes each field of the `stylusTracer` return value.

| Field Name | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | Name of the execute HostIO.                                     |
| `args`     | Arguments of the HostIO encoded as hex.                         |
| `outs`     | Outputs of the HostIO encoded as hex.                           |
| `startInk` | Amount of Ink before executing the HostIO.                      |
| `endInk`   | Amount of Ink after executing the HostIO.                       |
| `address`  | For \*call HostIOs, the address of the called contract.         |
| `steps`    | For \*call HostIOs, the steps performed by the called contract. |

For example, the command below illustrates how to call this tracer for a transaction.

```
curl -s \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"debug_traceTransaction","params":["<transaction-hash>", {"tracer": "stylusTracer"}],"id":1}' \
    <nitro-node-rpc>
```

The result of this call will be something along the lines of.

```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    {
      "args": "0x00000024",

      "name": "user_entrypoint",
      "outs": "0x",
      "startInk": 116090000
    },
    {
      "args": "0x",
      "endInk": 116057558,
      "name": "msg_reentrant",
      "outs": "0x00000000",

    },
    {

    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
