The following tools will help you debug your decentralized apps (dApps):

### Tenderly

Based on the provided Tenderly documentation, I can help expand the list with additional key features and capabilities. Here's how I would enhance the description:

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co) is a full-stack Web3 infrastructure platform that provides comprehensive debugging capabilities alongside development, monitoring, and infrastructure tools for Ethereum, Arbitrum, and other EVM chains. Key features include:

* [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/explorer) provides enhanced transaction and contract insights with decoded transaction data.
* [Debugger](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrumtrum) allows detailed transaction analysis with decoded stack traces, state changes, and event logs in a human-readable format.
* [Simulator](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulator-ui?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrumtrum) for testing transaction outcomes before deployment, with capabilities to simulate bundled transactions and optimize token transfers using various strategies.
* [Virtual TestNets](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrumtrum) for development, debugging, and staging. With Virtual TestNets, developers can provision isolated environments with access to correct mainnet data, test DAO proposals, validate protocol upgrades, and utilize unlimited faucet functionality for native and ERC-20 tokens.
* [Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrumtrum) and [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=arbitrumtrum) let developers set up real-time monitoring to catch and debug issues in production, implement automated responses to on-chain events, and build runtime invariant checkers.

Although Tenderly provides great debugging options, there are certain limitations when debugging parent-to-child chain messages (also known as Retryable Tickets), due to the utilization of custom Geth errors. For further information on this constraint, please refer to the following [resource](/for-devs/troubleshooting-building#i-tried-to-create-a-retryable-ticket-but-the-transaction-reverted-on-l1--how-can-i-debug-the-issue).

### Arbiscan

[Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) is a prominent blockchain explorer and analytics platform that allows users to access and analyze public data on the Arbitrum network, such as transactions, wallet addresses, and smart contracts. Arbiscan offers VMTrace and Debug tools to aid developers and users in understanding the execution of transactions on the Ethereum network. VMTrace provides a step-by-step visualization of the EVM execution, enabling developers to trace transaction processing and identify potential issues. Debug tools offer additional information such as input data, logs, and events emitted by the smart contract during execution.
