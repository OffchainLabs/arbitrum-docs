The following tools will help you debug your decentralized apps (dApps):

### Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) is an all-in-one Web3 development platform that empowers developers to build, test, monitor, and operate smart contracts from inception to mass adoption. Tenderly's debugging options focus on providing developers with efficient and user-friendly tools to identify and fix smart contract bugs and production issues. The Debugger enables developers to inspect smart contracts by analyzing precise lines of code in a human-readable format. With Tenderly's Simulator, developers can play out specific historical transactions and current transaction outcomes before sending them on-chain, allowing them to change relevant parameters and source code to test and debug contracts. The platform streamlines the debugging process, saving time and resources while improving smart contract reliability.

Although Tenderly provides great debugging options, there are certain limitations when debugging L1-to-L2 messages (also known as Retryable Tickets), due to the utilization of custom Geth errors. For further information on this constraint, please refer to the following [resource](/for-devs/troubleshooting-building#i-tried-to-create-a-retryable-ticket-but-the-transaction-reverted-on-l1--how-can-i-debug-the-issue).

### Arbiscan

[Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) is a prominent blockchain explorer and analytics platform that allows users to access and analyze public data on the Arbitrum network, such as transactions, wallet addresses, and smart contracts. Arbiscan offers VMTrace and Debug tools to aid developers and users in understanding the execution of transactions on the Ethereum network. VMTrace provides a step-by-step visualization of the EVM execution, enabling developers to trace transaction processing and identify potential issues. Debug tools offer additional information such as input data, logs, and events emitted by the smart contract during execution.
