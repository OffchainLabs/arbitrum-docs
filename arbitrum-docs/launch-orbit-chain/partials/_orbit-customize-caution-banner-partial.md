### Customizations require expertise
Customizing your chain is a core benefit of building with Arbitrum Orbit. We strongly recommend that teams interested in customizations work alongside a partner with expertise in ArbOS and Nitro software, such as a Rollup-as-a-Service team. 

Working alongside an experienced Orbit operator can help your team navigate the complex tradeoff space of rollup customizations, which can include performance, security, and cost considerations. Offchain Labs is positioned to train and enable Rollup-as-a-Service in their work with clients as a way to scale support to the Orbit ecosystem as a whole. As such, Offchain Labs does not necessarily have capacity to review code changes made by individual Orbit chains. 

We encourage you to leverage your in-house expertise, collaborate with expert partners, and allocate appropriate resources for both an initial implementation (including an audit) and ongoing maintenance and security management of your customization.
