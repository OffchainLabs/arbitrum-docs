This how-to will walk you through the process of adding your Orbit chain to the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). There's one section for mainnet Orbit chains, and another for local testnet Orbit chains. You can access either section using the links on the right column.

## Request adding a mainnet Orbit chain to the Arbitrum bridge

Mainnet Orbit chains can be added to the Arbitrum Bridge by filling out [this form](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues/new/choose).

Once receiving your request, our team will review and apply internal criteria to include your chain in the bridge. Here are some of the criteria that a chain must follow to be added to the bridge:

- The use case must fall within existing legal and marketing guidelines
- The core rollup / token bridge contracts must not have been modified, except the cases where modifications have been done with a certified partnership and communicated to Offchain Labs
- The infrastructure and core contracts are hosted by one of our partnered RaaS teams

## Add a local testnet Orbit chain to the Arbitrum bridge

To add a testnet Orbit chain to the Arbitrum bridge you can submit a request at the same GitHub link and indicate that it is a testnet (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues/new/choose).



Congratulations! Your chain should now appear in both the network dropdown in the top navigation pane, and as an option in the bridging UI directly.
