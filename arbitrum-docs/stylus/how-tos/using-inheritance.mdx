Inheritance allows you to build upon existing smart contract functionality without duplicating code. In Stylus, the Rust SDK provides tools to implement inheritance patterns similar to Solidity, but with some important differences. This guide walks you through implementing inheritance in your Stylus smart contracts.

## Overview

The Stylus SDK offers two approaches to inheritance:

1. **Trait-based composition**: The recommended approach using traits and the `#[implements]` annotation
2. **Storage-based inheritance**: The original model using `#[borrow]` and `#[inherit]` annotations

<VanillaAdmonition type="info" title="Stylus SDK evolution">
  As the Stylus SDK evolves, trait-based composition is becoming the preferred approach for new development. This approach aligns better with Rust's composition patterns and provides stronger type safety.
</VanillaAdmonition>

<VanillaAdmonition type="warning">
  Stylus doesn't currently support contract multi-inheritance yet, so you should design your
  contracts accordingly.
</VanillaAdmonition>

## Getting started

Before implementing inheritance, ensure you have:

<CustomDetails summary="Rust toolchain">

Follow the instructions on [Rust Lang's installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a complete Rust toolchain (v1.81 or newer) on your system. After installation, ensure you can access the programs `rustup`, `rustc`, and `cargo` from your preferred terminal application.

</CustomDetails>

<CustomDetails summary="cargo stylus">

In your terminal, run:

```shell
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```

Add WASM ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) as a build target for the specific Rust toolchain you are using. The below example sets your default Rust toolchain to 1.81 as well as adding the WASM build target:

```shell
rustup default 1.81
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.81
```

You can verify that cargo stylus is installed by running `cargo stylus --help` in your terminal, which will return a list of helpful commands.

</CustomDetails>

## Trait-based composition model

The recommended approach to inheritance in Stylus uses traits and the `#[implements]` annotation, which follows Rust's standard composition patterns:

### Basic example of trait-based composition

<CustomDetails summary="Trait-Based Inheritance Example">

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{
    alloy_primitives::{Address, U256},
    prelude::*,
    storage::{StorageAddress, StorageMap, StorageU256},
};

// Define traits for different functionality
trait IErc20 {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
    fn symbol(&self) -> String;
    fn decimals(&self) -> U256;
    fn total_supply(&self) -> U256;
    fn balance_of(&self, account: Address) -> U256;
    fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, value: U256) -> bool;
}

trait IOwnable {
    fn owner(&self) -> Address;
    fn transfer_ownership(&mut self, new_owner: Address) -> bool;
    fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) -> bool;
}

// Define storage for each component
#[storage]
struct Erc20 {
    balances: StorageMap<Address, StorageU256>,
    total_supply: StorageU256,
}

#[storage]
struct Ownable {
    owner: StorageAddress,
}

// Define the main contract that composes different functionality
#[storage]
#[entrypoint]
struct Contract {
    erc20: Erc20,
    ownable: Ownable,
}

// The #[implements] attribute connects the contract to the traits it implements
#[public]
#[implements(IErc20, IOwnable)]
impl Contract {}

// Implement the ERC20 interface for the contract
#[public]
impl IErc20 for Contract {
    fn name(&self) -> String {
        "MyToken".to_string()
    }
    
    fn symbol(&self) -> String {
        "MTK".to_string()
    }
    
    fn decimals(&self) -> U256 {
        U256::from(18)
    }
    
    fn total_supply(&self) -> U256 {
        self.erc20.total_supply.get()
    }
    
    fn balance_of(&self, account: Address) -> U256 {
        self.erc20.balances.get(account)
    }
    
    fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, value: U256) -> bool {
        // Implementation here
        true
    }
}

// Implement the Ownable interface for the contract
#[public]
impl IOwnable for Contract {
    fn owner(&self) -> Address {
        self.ownable.owner.get()
    }
    
    fn transfer_ownership(&mut self, new_owner: Address) -> bool {
        // Implementation here
        true
    }
    
    fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) -> bool {
        // Implementation here
        true
    }
}
```

</CustomDetails>

### How trait-based composition works

The trait-based composition model follows these principles:

1. Define traits that represent interfaces (similar to Solidity interfaces)
2. Implement these traits for your contract
3. Use the `#[implements(...)]` attribute to tell the Stylus SDK which traits your contract implements
4. The router will connect incoming calls to the appropriate implementation

This approach is more aligned with Rust's composition patterns and offers better type safety compared to the storage-based inheritance model.

### ABI export considerations with trait-based composition

When using trait-based inheritance, you need to be careful about function selectors to ensure correct ABI generation. Due to how Rust handles traits, you may need to explicitly set selectors for methods to match Solidity's expected function signatures.

<VanillaAdmonition type="caution" title="Selector Precision">
  When implementing traits with methods that have matching names, you must manually use the `#[selector(name = "ActualName")]` attribute to avoid method selector collisions. This is particularly important when implementing standard interfaces like ERC-20 or ERC-721.
</VanillaAdmonition>

<CustomDetails summary="Selector Issue Example">

```rust
// In Solidity, both these functions would have different selectors:
// function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)
// function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data)

// In Rust, we need to use different method names, but want the same selectors:
#[public]
impl<T: Erc721Params> Erc721<T> {
    // Use the #[selector] attribute to specify the correct Solidity-compatible name
    #[selector(name = "safeTransferFrom")]
    pub fn safe_transfer_from_with_data<S: TopLevelStorage + BorrowMut<Self>>(
        storage: &mut S,
        from: Address,
        to: Address,
        token_id: U256,
        data: Bytes,
    ) -> Result<(), Erc721Error> {
        // Implementation
    }

    // This method also needs the same selector name
    #[selector(name = "safeTransferFrom")]
    pub fn safe_transfer_from<S: TopLevelStorage + BorrowMut<Self>>(
        storage: &mut S,
        from: Address,
        to: Address,
        token_id: U256,
    ) -> Result<(), Erc721Error> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

</CustomDetails>

### Best practices for ABI correctness

1. **Be explicit with selectors**: When implementing standard interfaces (like ERC-20 or ERC-721), always use the `#[selector]` attribute to match the expected Solidity function names.

2. **Check for name collisions**: Methods with the same name but different parameters need explicit selectors.

3. **Verify generated ABIs**: After compiling your contract, inspect the generated ABI to ensure all methods have the correct selectors.

4. **Test with interface contracts**: Test your contract against a standard interface contract to verify compatibility.

<VanillaAdmonition type="info" title="ABI Generation and Inheritance">
  The Stylus SDK generates ABIs based on the methods that are available at the entrypoint contract.
  When using inheritance, make sure that all methods you want exposed in the ABI are properly
  included through the #[implements] attribute.
</VanillaAdmonition>

## Storage-based inheritance model

<VanillaAdmonition type="note" title="Storage-based inheritance support">
  While still supported, the storage-based inheritance model is gradually being replaced by the trait-based composition model in newer versions of the Stylus SDK. For new development, consider using the trait-based approach.
</VanillaAdmonition>

The original inheritance pattern in Stylus requires two components:

1. A storage structure using the `#[borrow]` annotation
2. An implementation block using the `#[inherit]` annotation

When you use these annotations properly, the child contract will be able to inherit the public methods from the parent contract.

### Basic inheritance pattern

Let's walk through a practical example of implementing inheritance in Stylus using the storage-based model.

#### Step 1: Define the base contract

First, define your base contract that will be inherited:

<CustomDetails summary="Base Contract Example">

```rust
// Import necessary components from the Stylus SDK
// - alloy_primitives::U256 for 256-bit unsigned integers (equivalent to uint256 in Solidity)
// - prelude contains common traits and macros used in most Stylus contracts
use stylus_sdk::{alloy_primitives::U256, prelude::*};

// Define the storage layout for our base contract
// sol_storage! is a macro that generates Rust structs with fields mapped to
// Solidity-equivalent storage slots and types
sol_storage! {
    // Public struct that will hold our contract's state
    pub struct BaseContract {
        // This defines a uint256 field in storage, equivalent to Solidity's uint256
        uint256 value;
    }
}

// Mark this implementation block as containing public methods
// The #[public] macro makes these methods available to be called from other contracts
#[public]
impl BaseContract {
    // Read-only function to retrieve the stored value
    // - &self indicates this is a view function (doesn't modify state)
    // - Returns either a U256 value or an error as Vec<u8>
    pub fn get_value(&self) -> Result<U256, Vec<u8>> {
        // Retrieve the value from storage and return it wrapped in Ok
        Ok(self.value.get())
    }

    // Mutable function to update the stored value
    // - &mut self indicates this function can modify state
    // - Takes a new_value parameter of type U256
    // - Returns either unit type () or an error
    pub fn set_value(&mut self, new_value: U256) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Update the storage value with the new value
        self.value.set(new_value);
        // Return success (no error)
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

</CustomDetails>

In this example, we've created a simple base contract with a single state variable and two methods to get and set its value.

#### Step 2: Define the child contract with inheritance

Next, create your child contract that inherits from the base contract:

<CustomDetails summary="Child Contract Example">

```rust
// Define the storage layout for our child contract that inherits from BaseContract
sol_storage! {
    // #[entrypoint] marks this struct as the main entry point for the contract
    // When the contract is called, execution begins here
    #[entrypoint]
    pub struct ChildContract {
        // #[borrow] enables the contract to borrow BaseContract's implementation
        // This is crucial for inheritance - it implements the Borrow trait automatically
        // Without this, the contract couldn't access BaseContract's methods
        #[borrow]
        BaseContract base_contract;

        // Additional state variable specific to the child contract
        // This extends the parent contract's state
        uint256 additional_value;
    }
}

// Define the public implementation for ChildContract
// #[public] makes these methods callable from other contracts or externally
#[public]
// #[inherit(BaseContract)] connects ChildContract to BaseContract via the Router trait
// This allows ChildContract to inherit all BaseContract's public methods
#[inherit(BaseContract)]
impl ChildContract {
    // Define a method specific to the child contract to get its additional value
    // Similar to BaseContract.get_value() but for the child's own state
    pub fn get_additional_value(&self) -> Result<U256, Vec<u8>> {
        // Access the child-specific storage value
        Ok(self.additional_value.get())
    }

    // Define a method to set the additional value
    // Similar to BaseContract.set_value() but for the child's own state
    pub fn set_additional_value(&mut self, new_value: U256) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Update the child-specific storage value
        self.additional_value.set(new_value);
        // Return success
        Ok(())
    }

    // Note: ChildContract can also call methods on BaseContract like:
    // self.base_contract.get_value() or self.base_contract.set_value()

    // Additionally, external callers can call BaseContract methods directly on ChildContract
    // due to the #[inherit] annotation, e.g.:
    // child_contract.get_value() - will call BaseContract.get_value()
}
```

</CustomDetails>

#### How it works

In the above code, when someone calls the `ChildContract` on a function defined in `BaseContract`, like `get_value()`, the function from `BaseContract` will be executed.

Here's the step-by-step process of how inheritance works in Stylus:

1. The `#[entrypoint]` macro on `ChildContract` marks it as the entry point for Stylus execution
2. The `#[borrow]` annotation on the `BaseContract` field implements the `Borrow<BaseContract>` trait, allowing the child to access the parent's storage
3. The `#[inherit(BaseContract)]` annotation on the implementation connects the child to the parent's methods through the Router trait

When a method is called on `ChildContract`, it first checks if the requested method exists within `ChildContract`. If a matching function is not found, it will then try the `BaseContract`. Only after trying everything `ChildContract` inherits will the call revert.

## Method overriding

If both parent and child implement the same method, the one in the child will override the one in the parent. This allows for customizing inherited functionality.

For example:

<CustomDetails summary="Method Overriding Example">

```rust
// Define implementation for ChildContract that will override a parent method
#[public]
// Inherit from BaseContract to get access to its methods
#[inherit(BaseContract)]
impl ChildContract {
    // This deliberately has the same name as BaseContract.set_value
    // When this method is called, it will be chosen over the parent's implementation
    // This is method overriding in Stylus
    pub fn set_value(&mut self, new_value: U256) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Add custom validation logic in the overridden method
        // This demonstrates extending parent functionality with additional checks
        if new_value > U256::from(100) {
            // Create a custom error message and convert it to bytes
            // This will be returned as an error, causing the transaction to revert
            return Err("Value too large".as_bytes().to_vec());
        }

        // If validation passes, call the parent's implementation
        // This shows composition pattern - reusing parent logic while adding your own
        // The ? operator unwraps the Result or returns early if it's an Err
        self.base_contract.set_value(new_value)?;

        // Return success if everything worked
        Ok(())
    }

    // Note: Without explicit override keywords (like in Solidity),
    // you must be careful about naming to avoid unintentional overrides
}
```

</CustomDetails>

<VanillaAdmonition type="caution" title="No Explicit Override Keywords">
  Stylus does not currently contain explicit override or virtual keywords for explicitly marking
  override functions. It is important, therefore, to carefully ensure that contracts are only
  overriding the functions you intend to override.
</VanillaAdmonition>

## Methods search order

When using inheritance, it's important to understand the order in which methods are searched:

1. The search starts in the type that uses the `#[entrypoint]` macro
2. If the method is not found, the search continues in the inherited types or implemented traits, in the order specified in the `#[inherit]` or `#[implements]` annotation
3. If the method is not found in any inherited type, the call reverts

In a typical inheritance chain:

- Calling a method first searches in the child contract
- If not found there, it looks in the first parent specified in the inheritance list
- If still not found, it searches in the next parent in the list
- This continues until the method is found or all possibilities are exhausted

## Choosing between inheritance models

Both inheritance models in Stylus have their strengths:

1. **Trait-based composition** (`traits` and `#[implements]`):
   - More Rust-idiomatic approach
   - Better type safety
   - Clearer separation of interfaces and implementations
   - More flexible composition patterns
   - Recommended for new development

2. **Storage-based inheritance** (`#[borrow]` and `#[inherit]`):
   - Closer to Solidity's inheritance model
   - More intuitive for Solidity developers
   - Good for direct ports of existing Solidity contracts

For new projects, the trait-based approach is generally recommended as it aligns better with Rust's composition patterns and provides stronger compile-time guarantees.

## Current limitations and best practices

### Limitations

1. Stylus doesn't support Solidity-style multiple inheritance yet (though you can inherit from a chain of contracts)
2. The storage layout for inherited contracts differs from Solidity's inheritance model (Stylus packs nested structs into their own slots)
3. There's a risk of undetected selector collisions with functions from inherited contracts
4. No explicit override or virtual keywords for clearly marking overridden functions
5. The inheritance mechanism does not automatically emit events that would be emitted by the parent contract (you need to explicitly call the parent's methods)

### Best practices

1. For new development, prefer the trait-based composition model with `#[implements]`
2. Be explicit with function selectors using `#[selector(name = "FunctionName")]` when implementing standard interfaces
3. Use `cargo expand` to examine the expanded code and verify inheritance is working as expected
4. Be cautious with method overriding since there are no explicit override keywords
5. Design your contracts with single inheritance in mind
6. Test thoroughly to ensure all inherited methods work correctly
7. Be aware of potential storage layout differences when migrating from Solidity
8. Always use `self.vm()` methods for accessing blockchain context (instead of deprecated functions like `msg::sender()`)
9. When overriding methods that emit events in the parent contract, make sure to explicitly call the parent method or re-emit the events
10. Use feature flags to control which contract is the entrypoint when working with multiple contracts

## Debugging inheritance issues

If you encounter issues with inheritance in your Stylus contracts, try these approaches:

1. Verify the proper annotations are used (`#[implements]` for trait-based, `#[borrow]` and `#[inherit]` for storage-based)
2. Ensure all function selectors are correctly specified when implementing standard interfaces
3. Check for method name conflicts between parent and child contracts
4. Use the `cargo stylus check` command to verify your contract compiles correctly
5. Use `cargo clippy` to check for Rust-specific issues and stylus-specific lints
6. Test individual methods from both the parent and child contracts to isolate issues
7. If you encounter symbol collision errors with `mark_used`, ensure you're only compiling one contract as the entrypoint at a time using feature flags
8. For VM context errors, verify you're using `self.vm()` methods instead of deprecated global functions
