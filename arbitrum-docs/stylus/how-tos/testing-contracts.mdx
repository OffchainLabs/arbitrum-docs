## Introduction

The Stylus SDK provides a robust testing framework that allows developers to write and run tests for their contracts directly in Rust without deploying to a blockchain. This guide will walk you through the process of writing and running tests for Stylus contracts using the built-in testing framework.

The Stylus testing framework allows you to:

- Simulate a complete Ethereum environment for your tests without the need for running a test node
- Test contract storage operations and state transitions
- Mock transaction context and block information
- Test contract-to-contract interactions with mocked calls
- Verify contract logic without deployment costs or delays
- Simulate various user scenarios and edge cases

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Basic familiarity with Rust and smart contract development
- Understanding of unit testing concepts
- Rust toolchain: follow the instructions on [Rust Lang's installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a complete Rust toolchain (v1.81 or newer) on your system. After installation, ensure you can access the programs `rustup`, `rustc`, and `cargo` from your preferred terminal application.

## The Stylus Testing Framework

The Stylus SDK includes `stylus_test`, a module that provides all the tools you need to test your contracts. This module includes:

- **TestVM**: A mock implementation of the Stylus VM that can simulate all host functions
- **TestVMBuilder**: A builder pattern to conveniently configure the test VM
- Built-in utilities for mocking calls, storage, and other EVM operations

### Key Components

Here are the components you'll use when testing your Stylus contracts:

- **TestVM**: The core component that simulates the Stylus execution environment
- **Storage accessors**: For testing contract state changes
- **Call mocking**: For simulating interactions with other contracts
- **Block context**: For testing time-dependent logic

## Example Smart Contract: Cupcake Vending Machine

Let's look at a Rust-based cupcake vending machine smart contract. This contract follows two simple rules:

1. The vending machine will distribute a cupcake to anyone who hasn't received one in the last 5 seconds
2. The vending machine tracks each user's cupcake balance

<CustomDetails summary="Cupcake Vending Machine Contract">

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(any(test, feature = "export-abi")), no_main)]
extern crate alloc;

/// Import items from the SDK. The prelude contains common traits and macros.
use stylus_sdk::alloy_primitives::{Address, U256};
use stylus_sdk::console;
use stylus_sdk::prelude::\*;

sol_storage! { #[entrypoint]
pub struct VendingMachine {
mapping(address => uint256) cupcake_balances;
mapping(address => uint256) cupcake_distribution_times;
}
}

#[public]
impl VendingMachine {
pub fn give_cupcake_to(&mut self, user_address: Address) -> Result<bool, Vec<u8>> {
// Get the last distribution time for the user.
let last_distribution = self.cupcake_distribution_times.get(user_address);
// Calculate the earliest next time the user can receive a cupcake.
let five_seconds_from_last_distribution = last_distribution + U256::from(5);

        // Get the current block timestamp using the VM pattern
        let current_time = self.vm().block_timestamp();
        // Check if the user can receive a cupcake.
        let user_can_receive_cupcake =
            five_seconds_from_last_distribution <= U256::from(current_time);

        if user_can_receive_cupcake {
            // Increment the user's cupcake balance.
            let mut balance_accessor = self.cupcake_balances.setter(user_address);
            let balance = balance_accessor.get() + U256::from(1);
            balance_accessor.set(balance);

            // Get current timestamp using the VM pattern BEFORE creating the mutable borrow
            let new_distribution_time = self.vm().block_timestamp();

            // Update the distribution time to the current time.
            let mut time_accessor = self.cupcake_distribution_times.setter(user_address);
            time_accessor.set(U256::from(new_distribution_time));
            return Ok(true);
        } else {
            // User must wait before receiving another cupcake.
            console!(
                "HTTP 429: Too Many Cupcakes (you must wait at least 5 seconds between cupcakes)"
            );
            return Ok(false);
        }
    }
    pub fn get_cupcake_balance_for(&self, user_address: Address) -> Result<U256, Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(self.cupcake_balances.get(user_address))
    }

}
```

</CustomDetails>

## Writing Tests for the Vending Machine

Now, let's write comprehensive tests for our vending machine contract using the Stylus testing framework. We'll create tests that verify:

1. Users can get an initial cupcake
2. Users must wait 5 seconds between cupcakes
3. Cupcake balances are tracked correctly
4. The contract state updates properly

### Basic Test Structure

Create a test file using standard Rust test patterns. Here's the basic structure:

```rust
// Import necessary dependencies
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;
    use alloy_primitives::address;
    use stylus_sdk::testing::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_give_cupcake_to() {
    // Set up test environment
    let vm = TestVM::default();
    // Initialize your contract
    let mut contract = VendingMachine::from(&vm);

    // Test logic goes here...
}
```

### Using the TestVM

The `TestVM` simulates the execution environment for your Stylus contract, removing the need to run your tests against a test node.
The `TestVM` allows you to control aspects like:

- Block timestamp and number
- Account balances
- Transaction value and sender
- Storage state

Let's create a comprehensive test suite that covers all aspects of our contract.

Below is a more advanced example test file, we'll go over the code features one by one:

<CustomDetails summary="Comprehensive Test Vending Machine Contract">

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;
    use alloy_primitives::address;
    use ethers::contract::multicall_contract::GetCurrentBlockTimestampCall;
    use stylus_sdk::testing::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_give_cupcake_to() {
        let vm = TestVM::default();

        let mut contract = VendingMachine::from(&vm);
        let user = address!("0xCDC41bff86a62716f050622325CC17a317f99404");
        assert_eq!(contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(), U256::ZERO);

        vm.set_block_timestamp(vm.block_timestamp() + 6);

        // Give a cupcake and verify it succeeds
        assert!(contract.give_cupcake_to(user).unwrap());

        // Check balance is now 1
        assert_eq!(
            contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(),
            U256::from(1)
        );

        // Try to give another cupcake immediately - should fail due to time restriction
        assert!(!contract.give_cupcake_to(user).unwrap());

        // Balance should still be 1
        assert_eq!(
            contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(),
            U256::from(1)
        );

        // Advance block timestamp by 6 seconds
        vm.set_block_timestamp(vm.block_timestamp() + 6);

        // Now giving a cupcake should succeed
        assert!(contract.give_cupcake_to(user).unwrap());

        // Balance should now be 2

    fn test_advanced_testvm_configuration() {
        // SECTION 1: TestVM Setup and Configuration
        // -----------------------------------------

        // Create a TestVM with custom configuration using the builder pattern
        // This approach allows for fluent, readable test setup
        let vm: TestVM = TestVMBuilder::new()
            // Set the transaction sender address (msg.sender in Solidity)
            .sender(address!("0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"))
            // Set the address where our contract is deployed
            .contract_address(address!("0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"))
            // Set the ETH value sent with the transaction (msg.value in Solidity)
            .value(U256::from(1))
            .build();

        // Configure additional blockchain state parameters directly on the VM instance
        // This demonstrates how to set parameters after VM creation
        vm.set_block_number(12345678);

        // Note: The chain ID is set to 42161 (Arbitrum One) by default in the TestVM
        // We don't need to set it explicitly as it's already configured in the VM state

        // SECTION 2: Contract Initialization and User Setup
        // ------------------------------------------------

        // Initialize our VendingMachine contract with the configured VM
        // The `from` method connects our contract to the test environment
        let mut contract = VendingMachine::from(&vm);

        // Define a user address that will interact with our contract
        // This represents an external user's Ethereum address
        let user = address!("0xCDC41bff86a62716f050622325CC17a317f99404");

        // SECTION 3: Initial State Verification
        // ------------------------------------

        // Verify the user starts with zero cupcakes
        // This confirms our contract's initial state is as expected
        assert_eq!(contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(), U256::ZERO);

        // Set the initial block timestamp by advancing it by 10 seconds
        // This ensures we're past any time-based restrictions
        vm.set_block_timestamp(vm.block_timestamp() + 10);

        // SECTION 4: Contract Interaction
        // ------------------------------

        // Give a cupcake to the user and verify the operation succeeds
        // The contract should return true when a cupcake is successfully given
        assert!(contract.give_cupcake_to(user).unwrap());

        // Verify the user now has exactly one cupcake
        // This confirms our contract correctly updated its storage
        assert_eq!(
            contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(),
            U256::from(1)
        );

        // SECTION 5: VM State Inspection
        // -----------------------------

        // Take a snapshot of the current VM state for inspection
        // This captures all storage, balances, and blockchain parameters
        let snapshot = vm.snapshot();

        // Inspect various aspects of the VM state to verify configuration
        // Chain ID should be Arbitrum One (42161) which is the default
        assert_eq!(snapshot.chain_id, 42161);
        // Message value should match what we configured (1 wei)
        assert_eq!(snapshot.msg_value, U256::from(1));

        // SECTION 6: Mocking External Contract Calls
        // -----------------------------------------

        // Define an external contract we might want to interact with
        let external_contract = address!("0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199");
        // Define example call data we would send to that contract
        let call_data = vec![0xab, 0xcd, 0xef];
        // Define the expected response from that contract
        let expected_response = vec![0x12, 0x34, 0x56];

        // Mock the external call so it returns our expected response
        // This allows testing contract interactions without deploying external contracts
        vm.mock_call(external_contract, call_data, Ok(expected_response));

        // SECTION 7: Time-Dependent Behavior Testing
        // -----------------------------------------

        // Set a specific block timestamp
        // This simulates the passage of time on the blockchain
        vm.set_block_timestamp(1006);

        // Try giving another cupcake after the time restriction has passed
        // The contract should allow this since enough time has elapsed
        assert!(contract.give_cupcake_to(user).unwrap());

        // Verify the user now has two cupcakes
        // This confirms our contract correctly handles time-based restrictions
        assert_eq!(
            contract.get_cupcake_balance_for(user).unwrap(),
            U256::from(2)
        );
    }

## Running Tests

To run your tests, you can use the standard Rust test command:

```shell
cargo test
```

Or with the `cargo-stylus` CLI tool:

To run a specific test:

```shell
cargo test test_give_cupcake
```

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**

   - Create a new `TestVM` instance for each test
   - Avoid relying on state from previous tests

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**

   - Test both success and error conditions
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Verify all public functions and important state transitions

3. **Clear Assertions**

   - Use descriptive error messages in assertions
   - Make assertions that verify the actual behavior you care about

4. **Realistic Scenarios**

   - Test real-world usage patterns
   - Include tests for authorization and access control

5. **Gas and Resource Efficiency**
   - For complex contracts, consider testing gas usage patterns
   - Look for storage optimization opportunities

## Migrating from Global Accessors to VM Accessors

As of Stylus SDK 0.8.0, there's a shift away from global host function invocations to using the `.vm()` method. This is a safer approach that makes testing easier. For example:

```rust
// Old style (deprecated)
let timestamp = block::timestamp();

// New style (preferred)
let timestamp = self.vm().block_timestamp();
```

To make your contracts more testable, make sure they access host methods through the `HostAccess` trait with the `.vm()` method.
