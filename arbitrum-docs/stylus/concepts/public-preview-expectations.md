Stylus is currently tagged as a `release-candidate` supported by _public preview_ documentation. This concept document explains what "public preview" means, what to expect from public preview capabilities, and how to engage with our team as you tinker.

### How products are developed at Offchain Labs

Offchain Labs builds products in a way that aligns loosely with the spirit of "building in public". We like to release things **early and often** so that we can capture feedback and iterate in service of your needs, as empirically as possible.

To do this, some of our product offerings are documented with **public preview** disclaimers that look like this:

import PublicPreviewBannerPartial from '../../partials/_public-preview-banner-partial.mdx';

<PublicPreviewBannerPartial />

This banner's purpose is to set expectations while inviting readers like you to express your needs so that we can incorporate them into the way that we iterate on product.

### What to expect when using public preview offerings

As you tinker and provide feedback, we'll be listening. Sometimes, we'll learn something non-obvious that will result in a significant change. More commonly, you'll experience incremental improvements to the developer experience as the offering grows out of its **public preview** status, towards **stable** status.

Public preview offerings are evolving rapidly, so don't expect the degree of release notes discipline that you'd expect from a stable offering. Keep your eyes open for notifications regarding patch, minor, and major changes, along with corresponding relnotes that highlight breaking changes and new capabilities.

### How to provide feedback

Our product team primarily uses three feedback channels while iterating on public preview capabilities:

1.  **Docs**: Click on the `Request an update` button located in the top-right corner of any document to provide feedback on the docs and/or developer experience. This will lead you to a prefilled Github issue that members of our product team periodically review.
2.  **Discord**: [Join the Arbitrum Discord](https://discord.gg/arbitrum) to engage with members of the Arbitrum community and product team.
3.  **Google form**: Complete [this form](http://bit.ly/3yy6EUK) to ask for support.

### What to expect when providing feedback

Our ability to respond to feedback is determined by our ever-evolving capacity and priorities. We can't guarantee responses to all feedback submissions, but our small-but-mighty team is listening, and we'll try our best to acknowledge and respond to your feedback. No guarantees though!

_PS, [our small-but-mighty team is hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/offchainlabs)._

### Thank you!

Thanks for helping us build things that meet your needs! We're excited to engage with OGs and newcomers alike; please don't hesitate to reach out.
