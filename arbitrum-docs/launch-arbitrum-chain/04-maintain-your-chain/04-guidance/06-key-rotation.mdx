# Arbitrum Node Key Rotation Guide

This guide covers how to rotate keys for different roles in your Arbitrum Orbit chain: batch poster, validator/staker, and Data Availability Servers (DAS).

## ⚠️ Important Prerequisites

- **Backup**: Always backup your current configuration and private keys before starting
- **Testing**: Test key rotation on a testnet environment first if possible
- **Downtime**: Plan for potential brief service interruptions during the rotation process
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to call the required smart contract functions

## 1. Batch Poster Key Rotation

> **Critical Warning**: For sequencer nodes running both sequencer and batch poster on the same server, you **must** split them first and configure Redis for message synchronization. Failure to do so may cause chain reorganizations. Refer to the [High Availability Sequencer documentation](/run-arbitrum-node/sequencer/05-high-availability-sequencer-docs.mdx) for setup instructions.

### Prerequisites

- New batch poster account funded with sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Access to call functions on the `SequencerInbox` contract
- Current batch poster should be stopped gracefully

### Steps

1. **Enable new batch poster**

   ```
   Call setIsBatchPoster(address=<new_address>, enabled=true) on SequencerInbox contract
   Call setBatchPosterManager(address=<new_address>) on SequencerInbox contract if you want to change batch poster manager
   ```

2. **Update node configuration**

   - Update your node configuration to use the new private key
   - Restart the batch poster service with the new configuration

3. **Handle potential mempool issues**
   If you encounter the error: `"posting this transaction will exceed max mempool size: transaction nonce: xxx, unconfirmed nonce: xx, max mempool size: xx"`

   **Temporary fix**:

   - Add `--node.batch-poster.data-poster.dangerous.clear-dbstorage` flag
   - Restart the batch poster
   - Remove this flag for next start

4. **Verify operation**

   - Monitor logs to confirm the new batch poster is successfully submitting batches
   - Check that transactions are being processed normally

5. **Disable old batch poster**
   ```
   Call setIsBatchPoster(address=<old_address>, enabled=false) on SequencerInbox contract
   ```

## 2. Validator/Staker Key Rotation

### Prerequisites

- New validator account funded with sufficient ETH
- Required stake amount available for the new validator
- Access to call functions on the `Rollup` contract

### Steps

1. **Enable new validator**

   ```
   Call setValidator(addr=<new_validator_address>, val=true) on Rollup contract
   ```

2. **Update node configuration**

   - Update your validator node configuration to use the new private key
   - Restart the validator service

3. **Handle potential mempool issues**
   If you encounter the error: `"posting this transaction will exceed max mempool size: transaction nonce: xxx, unconfirmed nonce: xx, max mempool size: xx"`

   - Add `--node.staker.data-poster.dangerous.clear-dbstorage` flag temporarily
   - Restart the validator
   - Remove this flag for next start

4. **Verify new validator operation**

   - Monitor that the new validator successfully posts stake transactions
   - Confirm assertion and confirmation transactions are being submitted

5. **Disable old validator**

   ```
   Call setValidator(addr=<old_validator_address>, val=false) on Rollup contract
   ```

6. **Recover old validator stake** (if applicable)
   - Wait your old validator's latest stake assertion to be confirmed
   - Call reduceDeposit() on Rollup Contract
   - Call withdrawStakerFunds() to get your stake back

## 3. AnyTrust Data Availability Committee (DAC) Rotation

### Prerequisites

- New DAC keyset generated
- Access to call functions on the `SequencerInbox` contract

### Steps

1. **Generate new keyset**

   - Follow the [Generate Keyset documentation](/run-arbitrum-node/data-availability-committees/configure-dac#step-1-generate-the-keyset-and-keyset-hash-with-all-the-information-from-the-servers) with your new group of DAS servers
   - Ensure all new DAS are properly configured and accessible

2. **Update keyset on-chain**

   ```
   Call setValidKeyset(keyset=<new_keyset>, assumedHonest=1) on SequencerInbox contract
   ```

   Note: `assumedHonest=1` assumes at least one committee member is honest

3. **Deploy new DAS servers**

   - Start the new DAS with the updated configuration
   - Verify they are accessible and responding to health checks

4. **Verify integration**

   - Monitor that the batch poster can successfully write batches to the new DAS servers
   - Check DAS server logs for successful data storage operations
   - Confirm data availability requests are being handled correctly
