This page lists the parent chains that are officially supported for Arbitrum chains, including mainnets, testnets, and options for local development. While the Arbitrum chain SDK provides functionality to enable custom parent chains, support is limited to the chains explicitly listed on this page. Developers are welcome to use the Arbitrum chain SDK to configure and deploy custom parent chains; however, such setups, including deploying the required creator and template contracts, are beyond the scope of our official support.

:::caution Supported Chains Only

Please note that we cannot guarantee compatibility or offer assistance for custom configurations outside of the supported chains detailed below.

### Adding custom parent chains

Although Arbitrum chains primarily supports a predefined set of chains, it provides developers with the flexibility to add custom parent chains through [the `registerCustomParentChain` function of the Arbitrum (Orbit) chain SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/729facd4d50156d7a84cf1204552c900eb86655c/src/chains.ts#L102). This capability enables integration with chains beyond the officially supported list, offering opportunities for customization and expanding the Arbtrium ecosystem.

However, adding a custom chain requires deploying essential contracts, such as the creator contract and template contract, on the target chain. These contracts are fundamental for ensuring the proper functioning of the Arbitrum chain framework on the custom chain.
