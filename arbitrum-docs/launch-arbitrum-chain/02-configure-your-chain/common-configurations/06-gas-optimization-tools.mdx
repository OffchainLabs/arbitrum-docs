To configure gas behavior on an Arbitrum Orbit chain, you primarily use the ArbOwner precompile (at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070`), which allows the chain owner to manage key parameters via function calls. These are invoked with post-deployment using tools like `cast` (from Foundry) or a custom script with a library like `ethers.js` or `viem`. Some parameters can also be set initially during chain deployment via the Arbitrum chain setup script's configuration (e.g., in fields like `minL2BaseFee` for the gas price floor). The defaults inherit from the parent chain or standard Nitro settings, but customization is possible for Arbitrum chains as they are permissioned by design.

Below is a breakdown of each specified parameter, including its role, typical defaults (based on Arbitrum One for reference), and how to configure it. Note that changes may require careful consideration to avoid impacting chain performance, user experience, or security—e.g., setting limits too high could lead to state bloat or slower block processing.

## Gas Speed Limit

- **Description**: This is the target gas consumption rate per second that the chain can sustainably handle. It influences the congestion mechanism: if gas usage exceeds this limit, the base fee rises to throttle demand; if below, the cost decreases (down to the floor). ArbOS uses this to update gas pools and enforce dynamic per-block gas limits.
- **Default (Arbitrum One)**: 7,000,000 gas/second.
- **Configuration**: Call the `setSpeedLimit(uint256 newSpeedLimit)` method on the ArbOwner precompile, where `newSpeedLimit` is the desired gas per second.

Example using `cast`:

```shell
cast send --rpc-url $ORBIT_RPC --private-key $OWNER_KEY 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 "setSpeedLimit(uint256)" $NEW_SPEED_LIMIT
```

This configuration is adjustable post-deployment. Any modifications should align with your node's capabilities to prevent issues with the congestion mechanism activating.

Refer to the [Chain parameters](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/03-chain-params.mdx) page, or the [Additional configuration parameters](/launch-arbitrum-chain/reference/additional-configuration-parameters.md) for more information.

## Block Gas Limit

- **Description**: This limits the maximum amount consumable by all transactions in a single L2 block. It helps control block size and processing time. In practice, ArbOS enforces a dynamic limit based on the speed limit and gas pools, but this sets a hard cap (often aligned with the maximum gas per transaction in the documentation, as blocks can contain multiple transactions).
- **Default (Arbitrum One)**: 32,000,000 gas per block.
- **Configuration**: Call the [`setMaxTxGasLimit(uint256 newLimit)`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbOwner) method on the [`ArbOwner` precompile](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbOwner), where `newLimit` is the desired max gas. This method is described as setting the block limit, although technically it may focus on per-transaction limits; in practice, it caps block usage.

Example using `cast`:

```shell
cast send --rpc-url $ORBIT_RPC --private-key $OWNER_KEY 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 "setMaxTxGasLimit(uint256)" $NEW_LIMIT
```

This setting is adjustable post-deployment. Setting it too high can harm user experience due to longer block times.

Refer to the [Chain parameters](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/03-chain-params.mdx) page, or the [Additional configuration parameters](/launch-arbitrum-chain/reference/additional-configuration-parameters.md) for more information.

## Gas Price Floor

- **Description**: This is the minimum L2 base fee (in `wei` per gas unit), preventing fees from dropping too low during low activity. The actual base fee fluctuates based on demand but won't go below this floor. It affects user transaction costs.
- **Default (Arbitrum One)**: 0.01 `gwei` (10,000,000 `wei`).
- **Configuration**:
  - **During deployment**: Set the `minL2BaseFee` field in the Orbit setup script's config JSON.
  - **Post-deployment**: Call the `setMinimumL2BaseFee(uint256 newMinBaseFee)` method on the [`ArbOwner` precompile](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbOwner), where `newMinBaseFee` is the value in `wei`.

Example using `cast`:

```shell
cast send --rpc-url $ORBIT_RPC --private-key $OWNER_KEY 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 "setMinimumL2BaseFee(uint256)" $NEW_FLOOR_IN_WEI
```

You can query the current floor via the ArbGasInfo precompile's `getMinimumGasPrice()`.

Refer to the [Chain parameters](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/03-chain-params.mdx), [Additional configuration parameters](/launch-arbitrum-chain/reference/additional-configuration-parameters.md), or the [How to manage the fee parameters](/launch-arbitrum-chain/02-configure-your-chain/common-configurations/07-fee-management.mdx) pages for more information.

## Per Batch Gas Cost

- **Description**: This refers to the fixed L2 gas charge applied for the overhead of posting each batch to the parent chain (e.g., Arbitrum One or Nova). It is used in transaction pricing to amortize the parent chain's fixed costs (like calldata posting) over the batch's transactions. It can be adjusted to reflect actual posting costs or incentivize batching. The surplus (if any) gets rewarded to the batch poster.
- **Default (Arbitrum One)**: Varies based on parent chain fees, but typically around 100,000 gas (adjustable to match).
- **Configuration**: Call the `setPerBatchGasCharge(int64 newCharge)` on the [`ArbOwner` precompile](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbOwner), where `newCharge` is the fixed gas units per batch. This configuration adjusts the allocation of L2 gas for batch overhead in pricing. Additionally, you can configure related surplus fees (extra reward to batch poster) via `setL1PricingRewardRate(uint64 rate)`. The actual cost is influenced by the parent chain base fee estimates, which are dynamic; therefore, monitor them via `ArbGasInfo`'s `getPricesInWei()` method.

Example using `cast` (for per batch charge):

```shell
cast send --rpc-url $ORBIT_RPC --private-key $OWNER_KEY 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000070 "setPerBatchGasCharge(int64)" $NEW_BATCH_COST
```

This configuration is adjustable post-deployment. For custom DA layers or parent chains, additional configuration may be required in the data availability setup.

Refer to the [How to manage the fee parameters](/launch-arbitrum-chain/02-configure-your-chain/common-configurations/07-fee-management.mdx) page for more information.

:::warning Caution

Always test changes on a devnet or testnet Orbit chain, as misconfiguration can lead to unexpected fee behavior or chain instability. Refer to the [`ArbOwnerPublic` precompile](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbOwner) for reading current settings without modifications. If using a custom gas token, ensure configurations are compatible. For deployment-specific initial configurations, refer to the Arbitrum chain quickstart script in the official documentation or SDK.
