<a data-quicklook-from="bold">Arbitrum BoLD</a> is the latest iteration of the Optimistic Rollup dispute
protocol used by Arbitrum chains today, like Arbitrum One. This page is intended for Arbitrum chain owners/operators
and assumes knowledge of Arbitrum BoLD is and experience upgrading an Arbitrum chain's Rollup contracts.
This page assumes you have read and followed the guide on [How to upgrade to BoLD](../../04-maintain-your-chain/05-upgrade-to-bold.mdx)
and our guide on [BoLD adoption for Arbitrum chains](../../bold-adoption-for-arbitrum-chains.mdx). Please
read these two guides first before proceeding with changing any of the parameters relating to BoLD below.

To read more about Arbitrum BoLD, please refer to the [Gentle Introduction for BoLD](../../../how-arbitrum-works/bold/gentle-introduction.mdx).

:::caution
As mentioned in our guide on [BoLD adoption for Arbitrum chains](../../bold-adoption-for-arbitrum-chains.mdx), the recommendation is that Arbitrum chains keep validation permissioned by having `disableValidatorWhitelist` be `false` (which is the default) and by having a list of validators on the whitelist via the `validators[]` array. Furthermore, it is recommended that the [Censorship Timeout](../../../how-arbitrum-works/03-sequencer.mdx#censorship-timeout) feature be kept disabled.
