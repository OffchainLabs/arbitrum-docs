 chains, including Orbit L2s and L3s, data posting costs refer to the fees incurred when the sequencer or batch posters submit compressed transaction batches to the parent chain (e.g., Ethereum L1 or an Arbitrum L2 like One/Nova) for data availability (DA). This ensures verifiability and security. Key elements include:

- **Parent Chain Base Fee**: Covers the core cost of posting data to the parent chain, estimated based on the transaction's compressed size (in data units) and the parent's current base fee. Retrieved via `ArbGasInfo.getL1BaseFeeEstimate()`. Automatically adjusted from batch poster reports, but can be manually set via `ArbOwner.setL1PricePerUnit(uint256)`. For chains using custom ERC-20 gas tokens, this should be disabled (set to 0) to avoid mischarges, as no ETH is used on the parent.
- **Parent Chain Surplus Fee**: An optional reward to incentivize batch posters, calculated as a rate (wei per gas unit) on top of the base fee. Retrieved via `ArbGasInfo.getL1RewardRate()` and set via `ArbOwner.setL1PricingRewardRate(uint64)`. Proceeds go to the `L1RewardRecipient` address.
- **Compression Mechanism**: Uses Brotli to minimize data size and costs. Each transaction is compressed individually at the lowest level for estimation, then batched. Compression levels adjust dynamically based on backlog size (e.g., level 6 for small backlogs, up to user-configured max for larger ones). This approximates per-transaction contributions (size × 16 gas per non-zero byte), though not exact due to shared patterns in batches.
- **Adaptive Pricing Algorithm**: Tracks funds collected vs. spent, updating the data unit price to minimize surpluses/deficits. Incorporates factors like surplus (S), derivative of surplus (D), and smoothing (α). Batch posting reports calculate actual costs by byte count and gas usage.
- **Fee Collection and Apportioning**: Fees are apportioned among transactions based on estimated data units. Collected via the reimbursement fund, with base fees to the batch poster's fee collector (via `ArbAggregator`) and surplus to `L1RewardRecipient`. Infrastructure costs (e.g., $600/month per sequencer replica) and validator bonds (e.g., 3600 ETH equivalent) add indirect expenses.
- **DA Options Impacting Costs**: 
  - **Rollup**: Posts all data to the parent (ultimately Ethereum), incurring higher calldata/blob costs but maximal security.
  - **AnyTrust**: Uses a Data Availability Committee (DAC) for off-chain storage, reducing fees (cheapest option) with fallback to on-chain posting.
  - **Celestia**: Integrates alt DA for potentially lower costs via modular layers.
- **Estimation Tools**: Use `NodeInterface.gasEstimateComponents()` or `NodeInterface.gasEstimateL1Component()` for previews; receipts show `gasUsedForL1`.

Overall, configurations aim for cost efficiency while ensuring sequencer reimbursement, with auto-adjustments for volatility.

### Decisions Regarding Data Posting Costs

Decisions are made at deployment (via Orbit SDK) or post-launch (via ArbOwner/ArbAggregator precompiles), often immutable or requiring governance. Focus on balancing cost, security, and UX; test on Sepolia. The table below outlines key areas:

| Decision Area | Key Considerations | Trade-offs |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|
| **DA Solution** | Choose Rollup (Ethereum DA), AnyTrust (DAC), or Celestia (alt DA). Set at genesis; AnyTrust offers ERC-20 gas token support. | Rollup: High security but costly DA; AnyTrust: Cheapest/flexible but trust in DAC; Celestia: Scalable/low-cost but external dependencies. |
| **Parent Chain Base Fee** | Set estimate via `setL1PricePerUnit`; auto-adjusts from reports. Disable (0) for custom gas tokens. | Accurate estimates prevent deficits but overestimation raises user fees; disabling avoids errors in non-ETH setups. |
| **Parent Chain Surplus Fee** | Set reward rate via `setL1PricingRewardRate`; choose `L1RewardRecipient`. | Higher rates incentivize posters but increase user costs; low/no reward may deter participation. |
| **Batch Poster Management** | Add posters via `addBatchPoster`; set fee collectors via `setFeeCollector`. Align with SequencerInbox. | More posters enhance decentralization but coordination complexity; fee distribution affects incentives. |
| **Compression and Batch Configs** | Set user-configured level (UC); adjust max tx data size via WASM root. | Higher compression reduces costs but increases compute; larger batches lower frequency/costs but risk delays. |
| **Challenge Period and Base Stake** | Set `confirmPeriodBlocks` (e.g., ~1 week); define base stake (ETH/ERC-20 bond). | Longer periods boost security but delay finality/costs; higher stakes deter attacks but limit validators. |
| **Gas Token and Min Base Fee** | Choose ETH or ERC-20; set min L2 base fee via `setMinimumL2BaseFee`. | Custom tokens add utility but overhead (e.g., funding for DA); low min fee risks DoS but lowers barriers. |
| **When to Customize** | For high-throughput chains, optimize compression/stakes; defaults suit general use. | Customization reduces costs but adds complexity/risks (e.g., DoS); consult Offchain Labs for non-standard.
