:::info RaaS providers

It is highly recommended to work with a Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) provider if you intend to deploy a production chain. You can find a list of RaaS providers [here](/launch-arbitrum-chain/06-third-party-integrations/02-third-party-providers.md#rollup-as-a-service-raas-providers).

:::

Creating a new Arbitrum chain involves deploying a set of contracts on your chain's <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a>. These contracts are:

- Bridge contracts: used to send cross-chain messages between the Arbitrum chain and its parent chain, including batches posted by the sequencer
- Rollup contracts: used by validators to create and confirm assertions of the current state of the Arbitrum chain
- Challenge protocol contracts: used by validators to dispute current assertions of the state of the chain, and ultimately resolve those disputes

You can explore the code of these contracts in the [nitro-contracts repository](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts).

This page explains how to deploy a <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-rollup-chain">Rollup Arbitrum chain</a> using the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK. See the [Overview](/launch-arbitrum-chain/arbitrum-chain-sdk-introduction.md) for an introduction to the process of creating and configuring an Arbitrum chain.

## Parameters used when deploying a new chain

Before we describe the process of creating a chain using the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK, let's see what configuration options we have available when creating a chain.

Deploying a new Arbitrum chain is done through a [RollupCreator](/launch-arbitrum-chain/03-deploy-an-arbitrum-chain/07-canonical-factory-contracts.mdx) contract that processes the creation of the needed contracts and sends the initialization messages from the parent chain to the newly created Arbitrum chain.

`RollupCreator` has a `createRollup` function that deploys your chain's core contracts to the parent chain. `createRollup` takes a complex struct called `RollupDeploymentParams` as its only input. This struct defines the parameters of the Arbitrum chain to be created.

```solidity
struct RollupDeploymentParams {
    Config config;
    address[] validators;
    uint256 maxDataSize;
    address nativeToken;
    bool deployFactoriesToL2;
    uint256 maxFeePerGasForRetryables;
    address[] batchPosters;
    address batchPosterManager;
}
```

The following table describes `RollupDeploymentParams`'s parameters:

| Parameter                   | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config`                    | Config    | The chain's configuration, explained below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `validators`                | address[] | Initial set of <a data-quicklook-from="validator">validator</a> addresses. Validators are responsible for validating the chain state and posting assertions (`RBlocks`) back to the parent chain. They also monitor the chain and initiate challenges against potentially faulty assertions submitted by other validators. |
| `maxDataSize`               | uint256   | Maximum message size for the Inbox contract (`117964` for L2 chains, and `104857` for L3 chains).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `nativeToken`               | address   | Address of the token contract in the parent chain, used for paying gas fees on the Arbitrum chain. It can be set to `ETH` for regular chains or to any `ERC-20` token for [custom gas token Arbitrum chains](/launch-arbitrum-chain/03-deploy-an-arbitrum-chain/04-deploying-custom-gas-token-chain.md).                   |
| `deployFactoriesToL2`       | bool      | Whether or not to deploy several deterministic factory contracts to the Arbitrum chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `maxFeePerGasForRetryables` | uint256   | Gas price bid to use when sending the retryable tickets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `batchPosters`              | address[] | Initial set of batch poster addresses. Batch posters batch and compress transactions on the Arbitrum chain and transmit them back to the parent chain.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `batchPosterManager`        | address   | Address of the account responsible for managing currently active batch posters. Not mandatory, as these actions can also be taken by the chain owner.                                                                                                                                                                      |

The `Config` struct used in the previous configuration looks like this:

```solidity
struct Config {
    uint64 confirmPeriodBlocks;
    address stakeToken;
    uint256 baseStake;
    bytes32 wasmModuleRoot;
    address owner;
    address loserStakeEscrow;
    uint256 chainId;
    string chainConfig;
    uint256 minimumAssertionPeriod;
    uint64 validatorAfkBlocks;
    uint256[] miniStakeValues;
    ISequencerInbox.MaxTimeVariation sequencerInboxMaxTimeVariation;
    uint256 layerZeroBlockEdgeHeight;
    uint256 layerZeroBigStepEdgeHeight;
    uint256 layerZeroSmallStepEdgeHeight;
    AssertionState genesisAssertionState;
    uint256 genesisInboxCount;
    address anyTrustFastConfirmer;
    uint8 numBigStepLevel;
    uint64 challengeGracePeriodBlocks;
    BufferConfig bufferConfig;
}
```

Most of these parameters don't need to be configured, since the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK will provide the right default values for them. However, the following table describes some of the parameters that you might want to configure:

| Parameter             | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `confirmPeriodBlocks` | uint64  | Sets the challenge period in terms of blocks, which is the time allowed for validators to dispute or challenge state assertions.

| `baseStake`           | uint256 | Arbitrum chain validator nodes must stake a certain amount to incentivize honest participation. This parameter specifies this amount.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `wasmModuleRoot`      | address | Hash of the WASM module root to be used when validating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `owner`               | address | Account address responsible for deploying, owning, and managing your Arbitrum chain's base contracts on its parent chain.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `loserStakeEscrow`    | address | Address that will receive any extra stakes deposited in the same assertion (when creating disputes).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `chainId`             | uint256 | Your chain's unique identifier. It differentiates your chain from others in the ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `chainConfig`         | string  | Additional chain configuration, explained below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The `chainConfig` parameter within the `Config` struct is a stringified `JSON` object that looks like this:

    InitialChainOwner: Address;
    GenesisBlockNum: number;
    MaxCodeSize: number;
    MaxInitCodeSize: number;
  }
}
```

Again, most of these parameters don't need to be configured, since the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK will provide the right default values for them. However, the following table describes some of the parameters that you might want to configure:

| Parameter                            | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chainId`                            | number  | Your chain's unique identifier. It differentiates your chain from others in the ecosystem.                                                                      |
| `arbitrum.DataAvailabilityCommittee` | bool    | Whether or not to use a Data Avalability Committee (DAC) to store your chain's data (this should be `false` for Rollup chains, and `true` for AnyTrust chains). |
| `arbitrum.InitialArbOSVersion`       | number  | ArbOS version to use (it should be the latest ArbOS version available).                                                                                         |
| `arbitrum.InitialChainOwner`         | address | Account address responsible for deploying, owning, and managing your Arbitrum chain's base contracts on its parent chain.                                       |
| `arbitrum.MaxCodeSize`               | number  | Sets the maximum size for contract bytecodes on the chain (it's recommended to use the default 24Kb, and not set it higher than 96Kb).                          |
| `arbitrum.MaxInitCodeSize`           | number  | Maximum initialization bytecode size allowed (usually double the amount set in `MaxCodeSize`).                                                                  |

## How to create a new Rollup chain using the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK

Now, let's look at the methods to use when creating a new Rollup Arbitrum chain with the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK.

:::info Example script

The Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK includes an example script for creating an Arbitrum chain. We recommend that you first understand the process described in this section and then check the [create-rollup-eth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/main/examples/create-rollup-eth/index.ts) script.

:::

### 1. Create the chain configuration object

The `prepareChainConfig` function creates a `chainConfig` structure like the one defined in the previous section. It sets the appropriate defaults for most of the parameters, allowing you to override any of these defaults. However, the `chainId` and `InitialChainOwner` parameters must be set to the desired values.

Below is an example of how to use `prepareChainConfig` to obtain the chain configuration for a Rollup chain with a specific `chainId` and `InitialChainOwner`:

```typescript
import { prepareChainConfig } from '@arbitrum/orbit-sdk';

const chainConfig = prepareChainConfig({
  chainId: 123_456,
  arbitrum: {
    InitialChainOwner: 0x123...890,
    DataAvailabilityCommittee: false,
  },
});
```

Once we have the `chainConfig`, we can use the function `createRollupPrepareDeploymentParamsConfig` to craft a `Config` structure like the one defined in the section above. Again, this function will set the appropriate defaults for most parameters, allowing you to override any of these defaults. However, the `chainId` and `owner` parameters must be set to the desired values. Additionally, a public client of the parent chain must be passed as an argument to the function.

Below is an example of how to use `createRollupPrepareDeploymentParamsConfig` to obtain the chain configuration for a Rollup chain with a specific `chainId` and `owner`:

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';
import { createRollupPrepareDeploymentParamsConfig } from '@arbitrum/orbit-sdk';

const parentChainPublicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: parentChain,
  transport: http(),
});

const createRollupConfig = createRollupPrepareDeploymentParamsConfig(parentChainPublicClient, {
  chainId: 123_456,
  owner: 0x123...890,
  chainConfig: chainConfig,
});
```

### 2. Deploy the Rollup Arbitrum chain

With the new crafted configuration, we can call the `createRollup` method which will send the transaction to the `RollupCreator` contract and wait until it is executed.

Besides the `Config` structure created in the previous step, other parameters from the `RollupDeploymentParams` structure can be passed to override the defaults set by the Arbitrum chain (Orbit) SDK. Batch poster and validator addresses must be set to the desired values. Additionally, a public client of the parent chain and a deployer PrivateKeyAccount must be passed as arguments to the function.

Below is an example of how to use `createRollup` using the `createRollupConfig` crafted in the previous step:

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { createRollup } from '@arbitrum/orbit-sdk';

const deployer = privateKeyToAccount(deployerPrivateKey);
const parentChainPublicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: parentChain,
  transport: http(),
});

const createRollupResults = await createRollup({
  params: {
    config: createRollupConfig,
    batchPosters: [batchPoster],
    validators: [validator],
  },
  account: deployer,
  parentChainPublicClient,
});
```

### 3. Understand the returned data

After calling `createRollup`, an object of type `CreateRollupResults` is returned with the following fields:

```typescript
type CreateRollupResults = {
  // The transaction sent
  transaction: CreateRollupTransaction;
  // The transaction receipt
  transactionReceipt: CreateRollupTransactionReceipt;
  // An object with the addresses of the contracts created
  coreContracts: CoreContracts;
};
```

### 4. Next step

Once the chain's contracts are created, you can move to the next step: [configure your Arbitrum chain's node](/launch-arbitrum-chain/how-tos/arbitrum-chain-sdk-preparing-node-config.md).
