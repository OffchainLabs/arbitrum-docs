:::caution

The guidance in this document will only work if you use `eth_call` to call the new precompiles. If you call them from other contracts or add non-view/pure methods, this approach will break the block validation.

To support these additional use-cases, follow the instructions described in [How to customize your Arbitrum chain's behavior](./customize-stf.mdx).

:::

There are five primary ways to customize your chain's precompiles:

1.  Add new methods to an existing [precompile](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/).
2.  Create a new precompile.
3.  Define a new event.
4.  Customize gas usage for a specific method.
5.  Call and modify state.

### Prerequisites

Clone the Nitro repository before you begin:

```shell
git clone --branch @@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@ <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro.git>
cd nitro
git submodule update --init --recursive --force
```

## Option 1: Add new methods to an existing precompile

Using your favorite code editor, open an existing precompile from the [precompiles implementation](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/) directory, `/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@`. We'll use `ArbSys.go` as an example. Open the corresponding Go implementation file (`ArbSys.go`) and add a simple `SayHi` method:

```go
func (con *ArbSys) SayHi(c ctx, evm mech) (string, error) {
	return "hi", nil
}
```

Then, open the corresponding Solidity interface file (`ArbSys.sol`) from the [precompiles interface](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroContractsRepositorySlug=nitro-precompile-interfaces@@/blob/@@nitroContractsCommit=fe4121240ca1ee2cbf07d67d0e6c38015d94e704@@/@@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@/) directory, `/@@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@`, and add the required interface. Ensure that the method name on the interface matches the name of the function you introduced in the previous step, `camelCased`:

```solidity
function sayHi() external view returns(string memory);
```

Next, follow the steps in [How to customize your Arbitrum chain's behavior](./customize-stf.mdx#step-3-run-the-node-without-fraud-proofs) to build a modified Arbitrum Nitro node docker image and run it.

Once your node is running, you can call `ArbSys.sol` either directly using `curl`, or through Foundry's `cast call`.

### Call your function directly using `curl`

```shell
curl http://localhost:8449 \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"method":"eth_call","params":[{"from":null,"to":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064","data":"0x0c49c36c"}, "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

You should see something like this:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000026869000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}
```

`0x6869` is the hex-encoded UTF-8 representation of `hi`, which you'll see embedded in the `result` hex string.

### Call your function using Foundry's `cast call`

```
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064 "sayHi()(string)”
```

You should see something like this:

```
hi
```

## Option 2: Create a new precompile

First, navigate to the [precompiles implementation](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/) directory, `/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@`, and create a new precompile implementation file called `ArbHi.go`. We'll define a new method, and we'll give it an address:

```go
package precompiles

// ArbHi provides a friendly greeting to anyone who calls it.
type ArbHi struct {
	Address addr // 0x11a, for example
}

func (con *ArbHi) SayHi(c ctx, evm mech) (string, error) {
	return "hi", nil
}
```

Then, update [precompile.go](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/precompile.go) to register the new precompile under the `Precompiles()` method:

```go
insert(MakePrecompile(pgen.ArbHiMetaData, &ArbHi{Address: hex("11a")})) // 0x011a here is an example address
```

Navigate to the [precompiles interface](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroContractsRepositorySlug=nitro-precompile-interfaces@@/blob/@@nitroContractsCommit=fe4121240ca1ee2cbf07d67d0e6c38015d94e704@@/@@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@/) directory, `/@@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@`, create `ArbHi.sol`, and add the required interface. Ensure that the method name on the interface matches the name of the function you introduced in the previous step, `camelCased`:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.9.0;

/// @title Say hi.
/// @notice just for test
/// This custom contract will set on 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a since we set it in precompile.go.
interface ArbHi {
    function sayHi() external view returns(string memory);
}
```

Next, follow the steps in [How to customize your Arbitrum chain's behavior](./customize-stf.mdx#step-3-run-the-node-without-fraud-proofs) to build a modified Arbitrum Nitro node docker image and run it.

Once your node is running, you can call `ArbHi.sol` either directly using `curl`, or through Foundry's `cast call`.

### Call your function directly using `curl`

```shell
curl http://localhost:8449 \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"method":"eth_call","params":[{"from":null,"to":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a","data":"0x0c49c36c"}, "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

You should see something like this:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000026869000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}
```

### Call your function using Foundry's `cast call`

```
cast call 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a "sayHi()(string)”
```

You should see something like this:

```
hi
```

## Option 3: Define a new event

We'll reuse the `Arbsys` precompile from Option 1 above to demonstrate how to emit a simple `Hi` event from the `SayHi` method in `ArbSys.sol`.

First, go to the [precompiles implementation](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/) directory, find `ArbSys.go`, and edit the `ArbSys` struct:

```go
// ArbSys provides system-level functionality for interacting with L1 and understanding the call stack.
type ArbSys struct {
	Address                 addr // 0x64
	L2ToL1Tx                func(ctx, mech, addr, addr, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, []byte) error
	L2ToL1TxGasCost         func(addr, addr, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, []byte) (uint64, error)
	SendMerkleUpdate        func(ctx, mech, huge, bytes32, huge) error
	SendMerkleUpdateGasCost func(huge, bytes32, huge) (uint64, error)
	InvalidBlockNumberError func(huge, huge) error

	// deprecated event
	L2ToL1Transaction        func(ctx, mech, addr, addr, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, []byte) error
	L2ToL1TransactionGasCost func(addr, addr, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, []byte) (uint64, error)

	// Add your customize event here:
	Hi						       func(ctx, mech, addr) error
	// This is needed and will tell you how much gas it will cost, the param is the same as your event but without the first two (ctx, mech), the return param is always (uint64, error)
	HiGasCost				    func(addr) (uint64, error)
}
```

Then add the event to the `SayHi` method:

```go
func (con *ArbSys) SayHi(c ctx, evm mech) (string, error) {
	err := con.Hi(c, evm, c.caller)
	return "hi", err
}
```

Now navigate to the [precompiles interface](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroContractsRepositorySlug=nitro-precompile-interfaces@@/blob/@@nitroContractsCommit=fe4121240ca1ee2cbf07d67d0e6c38015d94e704@@/@@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@/) directory, open `Arbsys.sol`, and add the required interface. Ensure that the event name on the interface matches the name of the function you introduced in `ArbSys` struct in the previous step:

```solidity
event Hi(address caller);
```

If you want to [index the parameter](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#events) of the event (if you want to filter by that parameter in the future, for example), just add `indexed` to the Solidity interface:

```solidity
event Hi(address indexed caller);
```

Our function now emits an event, which means that when calling it, the state will change and a gas cost will be incurred. So we have to remove the `view` function behavior:

```solidity
function sayHi() external returns(string memory);
```

Next, build Nitro by following the instructions in [How to build Nitro locally](/run-arbitrum-node/nitro/01-build-nitro-locally.mdx). Note that if you've already built the Docker image, you still need run the last step to rebuild.

Run Nitro with the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.6.5-89cef87@@ --parent-chain.connection.url=<YourParentChainUrl> --chain.id=<YourOrbitChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```

### Send the transaction and get the transaction receipt

To send a transaction to `ArbSys`, we need to include a gas cost, because the function is no longer a view/pure function:

```
cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064 "sayHi()(string)"
```

Call `eth_getTransactionReceipt` with the returned transaction hash result. You should see something like this:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"blockHash":"Your_blockHash","blockNumber":"Your_blockNumber","contractAddress":null,"cumulativeGasUsed":"0x680b","effectiveGasPrice":"0x5f5e100","from":"Your_address","gasUsed":"0x680b","gasUsedForL1":"0xe35","l1BlockNumber":"l1_blockNumber","logs":[{"address":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064","topics":["0xa9378d5bd800fae4d5b8d4c6712b2b64e8ecc86fdc831cb51944000fc7c8ecfa","0x000000000000000000000000{Your_address}"],"data":"0x","blockNumber":"Your_blockNumber","transactionHash":"Your_txHash","transactionIndex":"0x1","blockHash":"Your_blockHash","logIndex":"0x0","removed":false}],"logsBloom":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000040000000000000080004000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","status":"0x1","to":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064","transactionHash":"Your_txHash","transactionIndex":"0x1","type":"0x2"}}
```

Note the `logs` field within the transaction receipt:

```
"logs":[
         {
            "address":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064",
            "topics":[
               "0xa9378d5bd800fae4d5b8d4c6712b2b64e8ecc86fdc831cb51944000fc7c8ecfa",
               "0x000000000000000000000000{Your_address}"
            ],
            "data":"0x",
            "blockNumber":"0x40",
            "transactionHash":"{Your_txHash}",
            "transactionIndex":"0x1",
            "blockHash":"0x0b367d705002b3575db99354a0964c033f929f26f4442ed347e47ae43a8f28e4",
            "logIndex":"0x0",
            "removed":false
         }
      ]
```

## Option 4: Customize gas usage for a specific method

The above instructions demonstrate how you can define a new precompile function. However, if this new function is simply defined without performing gas collection within the function, your precompile will be vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks. These attacks exploit the function by flooding it with excessive requests without bearing the computational cost.

To deter this type of attack, you can implement a gas collection mechanism within your precompile. The event itself doesn't need to specify the gas cost; the program will calculate the gas cost when the event's execution is initially triggered.

In addition to introducing gas costs where they don't exist, you can also customize gas costs where they're already being incurred. To demonstrate, consider the `GetBalance` method in `ArbInfo.go`:

```
// GetBalance retrieves an account's balance
func (con ArbInfo) GetBalance(c ctx, evm mech, account addr) (huge, error) {
	if err := c.Burn(params.BalanceGasEIP1884); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return evm.StateDB.GetBalance(account), nil
}
```

The purpose of this method is to retrieve the balance of an address. As defined in [EIP1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884), the operation code (opcode) for obtaining the address balance has an associated gas cost of 700 gas. The function accounts for this cost by deducting the specified amount of gas, indicated by the protocol constant `BalanceGasEIP1884`, which is set to `700`, through the call to `c.Burn(int64)`.

To customize the gas cost, let's implement an alternative to `GetBalance`, called `GetBalanceCustom`:

```
// GetBalance retrieves an account's balance
func (con ArbInfo) GetBalanceCustom(c ctx, evm mech, account addr) (huge, error) {
	gasForBalanceCall := uint64(300)
	if err := c.Burn(gasForBalanceCall); err != nil {
		return evm.StateDB.GetBalance(account), err
	}
	return balance, nil
}
```

To register this new precompile method, refer to Option 1 above.

Next, build Nitro by following the instructions in [How to build Nitro locally](/run-arbitrum-node/nitro/01-build-nitro-locally.mdx). Note that if you've already built the Docker image, you still need run the last step to rebuild.

Run Nitro with the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.6.5-89cef87@@ --parent-chain.connection.url=<YourParentChainUrl> --chain.id=<YourOrbitChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```

### Send the transaction and get the transaction receipt

In order to obtain the gas used, we can use the `eth_sendRawTransaction` RPC method to test execution on the chain.
First, call:

```
cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065 "GetBalance()({Any_Address})"
```

Then, call:

```
cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065 "GetBalanceCustom()({Any_Address})"
```

The two responses will look like this, respectively:

Result 1:

```
{
   "jsonrpc":"2.0",
   "id":1,
   "result":{
      "blockHash":"{Your_blockHash}",
      "blockNumber":"0x15",
      "contractAddress":null,
      "cumulativeGasUsed":"0x638f",
      "effectiveGasPrice":"0x5f5e100",
      "from":"{Your_address}",
      "gasUsed":"0x638f",
      "gasUsedForL1":"0x9f5",
      "l1BlockNumber":"0x979a02",
      "logs":[

      ],
      "logsBloom":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "status":"0x1",
      "to":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065",
      "transactionHash":"{Your_txHash}",
      "transactionIndex":"0x1",
      "type":"0x2"
   }
}
```

Result 2:

```
{
   "jsonrpc":"2.0",
   "id":1,
   "result":{
      "blockHash":"{Your_blockHash}",
      "blockNumber":"0x16",
      "contractAddress":null,
      "cumulativeGasUsed":"0x61ff",
      "effectiveGasPrice":"0x5f5e100",
      "from":"{Your_address}",
      "gasUsed":"0x61ff",
      "gasUsedForL1":"0x9f5",
      "l1BlockNumber":"0x979a08",
      "logs":[

      ],
      "logsBloom":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "status":"0x1",
      "to":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000065",
      "transactionHash":"{Your_txHash}",
      "transactionIndex":"0x1",
      "type":"0x2"
   }
}
```

Here we can see that the gas cost incurred by the execution of the first transaction is `gasUsed - gasUsedForL1 = 22938`. Similarly, the gas cost incurred by the execution of the second transaction is `22538`. If you subtract the two, the result is `400`, as expected.

To learn more about the gas cost model, see [how to estimate gas](/build-decentralized-apps/02-how-to-estimate-gas.mdx).

## Option 5: Call and modify state

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to _read from_ and _write to_ a precompile contract's [ArbOS state](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v2.2.0/arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L38).

First, open the [arbosstate.go](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToArbosState=arbos/arbosState@@/arbosstate.go) file and locate the [ArbosState](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v2.2.0/arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L38) structure. This is where ArbOS state is defined.

Define a state key called `myNumber` of type `storage.StorageBackedUint64`. You can find more types in [storage.go](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToStorage=arbos/storage@@/storage.go):

```
type ArbosState struct {
	// Other states
	infraFeeAccount        storage.StorageBackedAddress
	brotliCompressionLevel storage.StorageBackedUint64 // brotli compression level used for pricing
	backingStorage         *storage.Storage
	Burner                 burn.Burner
	myNumber               storage.StorageBackedUint64 // this is what we added
}
```

Next, define the offset of your newly added state (tip: add it to the end so it won't affect other states):

```
const (
	versionOffset Offset = iota
	upgradeVersionOffset
	upgradeTimestampOffset
	networkFeeAccountOffset
	chainIdOffset
	genesisBlockNumOffset
	infraFeeAccountOffset
	brotliCompressionLevelOffset
	myNumberOffset // define the offset of your new state here
)
```

Then, initialize the state under the [OpenArbosState](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v2.2.0/arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L89) and [InitializeArbosState](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v2.2.0/arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L212) methods:

OpenArbosState:

```
return &ArbosState{
		// other states
		backingStorage.OpenStorageBackedAddress(uint64(infraFeeAccountOffset)),
		backingStorage.OpenStorageBackedUint64(uint64(brotliCompressionLevelOffset)),
		backingStorage,
		burner,
		backingStorage.OpenStorageBackedUint64(uint64(myNumberOffset)), // define your new state here
	}, nil
```

InitializeArbosState:

```
	_ = sto.SetUint64ByUint64(uint64(versionOffset), 1) // initialize to version 1; upgrade at end of this func if needed
	_ = sto.SetUint64ByUint64(uint64(upgradeVersionOffset), 0)
	_ = sto.SetUint64ByUint64(uint64(upgradeTimestampOffset), 0)
	_ = sto.SetUint64ByUint64(uint64(myNumberOffset), 0) // initialize your new state around here
```

Next, define your getter and setter::

```
func (state *ArbosState) SetNewMyNumber(
	newNumber uint64,
) error {
	return state.myNumber.Set(newNumber)
}

func (state *ArbosState) GetMyNumber() (uint64, error) {
	return state.myNumber.Get()
}
```

Next, head back to the [precompiles directory](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/@@nitroRepositorySlug=nitro@@/blob/@@nitroVersionTag=v3.6.5@@/@@nitroPathToPrecompiles=precompiles@@/) and create a new `ArbHi.go` (introduced in Option 2).
This time, we'll add two new methods to read and write the ArbOS state:

```
package precompiles

// ArbHi provides a friendly greeting to anyone who calls it.
type ArbHi struct {
	Address addr // 0x11a, for example
}

func (con *ArbHi) SayHi(c ctx, evm mech) (string, error) {
	return "hi", nil
}

func (con *ArbHi) GetNumber(c ctx, evm mech) (uint64, error) {
	return c.State.GetMyNumber()
}

func (con *ArbHi) SetNumber(c ctx, evm mech, newNumber uint64) error {
	return c.State.SetNewMyNumber(newNumber)
}
```

Follow the procedure detailed in Option 2 in order to add this new precompile contract, and then run your node.

Your smart contract interface should look like this:

```
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.9.0;

/// @title Say hi.
/// @notice just for test
/// This custom contract will set on 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a since we set it in precompile.go.
interface ArbHi {
    function sayHi() external view returns(string memory);
    function getNumber() external view returns(uint64);
    function setNumber(uint64) external;
}
```

### Send the transaction and get the transaction receipt

To send a transaction to `ArbSys`, we need to include a gas cost, because the function is no longer a view/pure function:

```
cast send 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a "setNumber()" "2"
```

### Get results from foundry cast

```
cast call 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000011a "getNumber()(uint64)”
```

You should see something like this:

```
2
```

## Incorporate your changes to precompile into the ArbOS upgrade

If you do not customize the precompile before launching your Arbitrum chain network, please continue to follow [customize arbos](./customize-arbos.mdx) to perform an ArbOS version control to avoid blockchain reorg.

<!-- For clarity in the code, we add here all links to github, using "link references" (First the interfaces, and below the implementations) -->
<!--
Note that nitro-contracts repository is hardcoded because atm we use the "nitro" repository for referencing precompiles for the current released nitro version  (for Arb chains),
but we use the "nitro-contracts" repo for Arbitrum chains (next nitro release version will use "nitro-contracts" for all chains though).
The same goes for the path to precompiles interface.
We can use the @@nitroContractsRepositorySlug=nitro-precompile-interfaces@@ and @@nitroContractsPathToPrecompilesInterface=/@@ variables once we release nitro version 2.1.0 or above.
