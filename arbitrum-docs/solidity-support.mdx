# Solidity Support

Arbitrum Nitro chains are Ethereum compatible, and therefore allow you to trustlessly deploy Solidity contracts (as well as Vyper or any other language that compiles to EVM bytecode).

# Differences from Solidity on Ethereum

Although Arbitrum supports Solidity code, there are differences in the effects of a few operations, including language features that don't make much sense in the Layer 2 context:

- `blockhash(x)` returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for `x` within the range `block.number - 256 <= x < block.number`. If `x` is outside of this range, `blockhash(x)` will return `0`. This includes `blockhash(block.number)`, which always returns `0` just like on Ethereum. The hashes returned do not come from L1.
- `block.coinbase` returns the designated internal address 0xA4b000000000000000000073657175656e636572 if the message was posted by a Sequencer. It it's a delayed message, it returns the address of the delayed message's poster (Note: the handling of delayed message's `block.coinbase` will likely be changed in ArbOS v11).
- `block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` returns the constant 1
- `block.number` return an "estimate" of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction (see [Block Numbers and Time](./time.mdx))
- `msg.sender` works the same way it does on Ethereum for normal L2-to-L2 transactions; for L1-to-L2 "retryable ticket" transactions, it will return the L2 address alias of the L1 contract that triggered the message. See [retryable ticket address aliasing](./arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) for more.
- OPCODE `push0` is not yet supported, but will soon be available. This means that solidity version `0.8.20` or higher can only be used with an evm-version lower than the default `shanghai` ([see instructions here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) to change that parameter in solc, or [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/compile-contracts#configuring-the-compiler) to set the `solidity` or `evmVersion` configuration parameters in hardhat). Versions up to `0.8.19` (included) are fully compatible.
