:::caution ALPHA RELEASE, PUBLIC PREVIEW DOCS

The BOLD dispute protocol is currently deployed on a public testnet (that posts assertions to Ethereum Sepolia) and is tagged as an `alpha` release. The code has been audited by [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf) and in a [public audit competition with Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold), but **should not be used in production scenarios**. Please note that the public testnet is intended for Arbitrum users and researchers to test and experiment with the BOLD dispute protocol for the purposes of education and hardening the protocol via the surfacing of bugs. The public testnet may be paused, and its parameters may be updated at any time in response to scenarios that impact the network and its ability to fulfill its function as a working, reliable test environment. This documentation is currently in [public preview](/stylus/concepts/public-preview-expectations.mdx).
