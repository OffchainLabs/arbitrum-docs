## Overview

<a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a>'s current dispute protocol involves defending against
challengers individually in a 1-vs-1 tournament setting. In contrast, <a data-quicklook-from="bold">
  BoLD
</a> enables an all-vs-all battle royale between Good and Evil, with a single winner always
determined. This dynamic is made possible by BoLD's time-bounded, permissionless validation using
deterministic Merkle proofs and hashes. This allows any party to bond in the correct state and prove
their claim through interactive fraud proofs, ensuring that a single honest party bonding in the
correct state will always prevail in disputes.

Validators on Arbitrum can post their claim on the validity of state roots, known as **assertions**. Ethereum, of course, does not know anything about the validity of these Arbitrum state roots, but it _can_ help prove their correctness. _Anyone_ in the world can then initiate a <a data-quicklook-from="challenge">challenge</a> over any unconfirmed <a data-quicklook-from="assertion">assertion</a> to start the protocol’s game.

The assertions being disputed concern block hashes of an <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-chain">Arbitrum chain</a> at a given <a data-quicklook-from="batch">batch</a>/inbox position. Given that Arbitrum chains are deterministic, there is only one correct history for all parties running the standard Nitro software. Using the notion of one-step proof, Ethereum can check whether someone is making a fraudulent assertion after an interactive game is played to narrow down a dispute.

If a claim is honest, it can be confirmed on Ethereum after a 6.4-day period (although the DAO can change this period). If a claim is malicious, anyone who knows the correct Arbitrum state can successfully challenge it within that 6.4-day window _and always win_ within a <a data-quicklook-from="challenge-period">challenge period</a> plus some small delta.

The current implementation of BoLD involves both onchain and offchain components:

1. Rollup contracts to be deployed on Ethereum.

2. New challenge management contracts to be deployed on Ethereum.

3. [Honest validator software](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) equipped to submit assertions and perform challenge moves on any assertions it disagrees with. The honest <a data-quicklook-from="validator">validator</a> is robust enough to win against malicious entities and always ensures honest assertions are the only ones confirmed onchain.

### Key terminology

- **Arbitrum Rollup contracts:** The set of smart contracts on Ethereum <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a> that serve as both the data availability layer for Arbitrum and for confirming the rollup's state assertions after a challenge period has passed for each assertion made.

- **Assertions:** A claim posted to the Arbitrum Rollup contracts on Ethereum (parent chain) about the Arbitrum (<a data-quicklook-from="child-chain">child chain</a>) execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum Rollup inbox contract. Each assertion can be confirmed after a period of 6.4 days, and anyone can challenge it during that period. A BoLD challenge will add an additional upper bound of 6.4 days to confirm an assertion. Gaining the right to post assertions requires placing a large, one-time bond, which can get taken away in the case of losing a challenge to a competing assertion.

- **Bonding:** Participants in the protocol need to bond a certain amount of `WETH` to gain the privilege of posting assertions to the Rollup contracts by locking up an `WETH` bond in the protocol contracts. Whenever someone wants to create a sub-challenge, they must also place a smaller bond called a challenge bond when they do so. Bonds, their rationale, and magnitude will be covered in greater detail in the [Opening challenges](#opening-challenges) and [Sub-challenges](#sub-challenges) sections below, as well as the [Economics of disputes](/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes.mdx) page.

- **Bonding of funds:** Creating an assertion in the Rollup contracts requires the submitter to join the validator set by putting up a large bond as `WETH`. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds. Instead, the protocol always considers validators bonded to their latest posted assertion. The bonded funds are taken away if another competing assertion is confirmed. When an assertion is confirmed, the associated bonded funds can be withdrawn.

- **Chain bindings:** Software that can interact with an Ethereum node in order to make calls and transactions to the onchain contracts needed for participating in the protocol. We utilize go-ethereum’s abigen utilities to create Go bindings to interact with the contracts above, with a few more developer-friendly wrappers.

- **ChallengeManager:** This is a contract that allows for initiating challenges on assertions and provides methods for anyone to participate in challenges in a permissionless fashion. BoLD will require a new `ChallengeManager` written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum. The challenge manager contains entry points for making challenge moves, opening leaves, creating sub-challenges, and confirming challenges.

- **Challenge manager <a data-quicklook-from="client">client</a>:** Software that can manage the life cycles of challenges that an <a data-quicklook-from="active-validator">active validator</a> participates in. Validators need to be able to participate in multiple challenges at once and manage individual challenge vertices correctly to act upon, confirm, or reject them.

- **Challenge period:** Window of time ([6.4 days on Arbitrum One](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/03-chain-params.mdx)) over which an assertion can be challenged, after which the assertion can be confirmed. This is configurable by the DAO.

- **<a data-quicklook-from="challenge-protocol">challenge protocol</a>:** A set of rules through which a disagreement on an assertion is resolved using Ethereum as the final arbiter. Ethereum's VM can verify one-step proofs of deterministic computation that will confirm a challenge winner in Arbitrum's Rollup contracts once the challenge period has elapsed.

- **Delay attacks:** In a delay attack, a malicious party (or group of parties) acts within the challenge protocol and tries to delay the <a data-quicklook-from="confirmation">confirmation</a> of results back to the parent chain. Before BoLD, the previous challenge protocol allowed adversaries to do this by forcing the honest party to play 1-vs-1 games against them to delay confirmation. In contrast, BoLD has a proven, constant upper bound on confirmation times for assertions in Arbitrum, addressing the biggest flaw of the current challenge mechanism. BoLD validators don’t need to play 1-vs-1 challenges and instead can defend a single assertion against many malicious claims. With delay attacks solved, Arbitrum will be able to allow permissionless validation.

- **Edge:** Edges are a portion of a claim made by a validator about the history of the chain from some end state all the way back to some initial state. Edges are the fundamental unit in a challenge.

- **Fraud proofs:** Proofs that prove or disprove that an invalid state transition has taken place. These proofs are generated by challenge participants and are submitted to a chain's parent chain. For example, Arbitrum Rollups that settle onto Ethereum will have their proofs submitted to Ethereum and verified via a <a data-quicklook-from="smart-contract">smart contract</a>. In this case, these proofs allow Ethereum to be the final arbiter of disagreements over assertions in the Rollup contracts, which cannot be falsified by any parties as there is only a single, correct result of executing a `<a data-quicklook-from="wasm">WASM</a>` instruction on a pre-state. WASM is the assembly language that is used to represent programs whose execution is being disputed. In fact, Arbitrum, before and after BoLD, uses a slightly different language called WAVM when executing challenges. The difference is not important to this discussion, but for details, see the page outlining the differences between [WASM and WAVM](/how-arbitrum-works/05-validation-and-proving/03-proving-and-challenges.mdx#7-wasm-to-wavm-transformation).

- **Honest validator:** An entity that knows the correct state of the Arbitrum child chain and who may want to participate in creating assertions, confirming assertions, and/or challenging invalid assertions if they exist. More specifically, this entity must run an <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-full-node">Arbitrum full node</a> in `MakeNodes`, `Defensive`, `StakeLatest`, or `ResolveNodes` mode as described in the [How to run a validator](/run-arbitrum-node/more-types/02-run-validator-node.mdx). Note that there must always be an active proposer (i.e., a validator who actively submits new assertions) to advance the chain and who will need to run a validator in `MakeNodes` mode.

- **OneStepProver:** A set of existing contracts that implement a miniature WASM VM capable of executing one-step-proofs of computation of the child <a data-quicklook-from="chain-state">chain state</a> transition function. This is implemented in Solidity and exists on Ethereum. No changes to the `OSP` contracts are needed for BoLD.

- **Permissionless validation:** The ability for anyone to interact with the Arbitrum Rollup contracts on Ethereum to both post assertions and challenge others' assertions without needing permission. With the release of BoLD, the Rollup contracts on Arbitrum will no longer have a permissioned list of validators.

- **Rollup contract:** This smart contract living on Ethereum allows validators to bond on state assertions about Arbitrum. It's known as [`RollupCore.sol`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol), and Arbitrum chains use it to post assertions. BoLD requires several changes to how assertions work in this contract, and it now contains a reference to another contract called a `ChallengeManager`, which is new in BoLD.

- **State manager backend:** Software that can retrieve child chain states and produce commitments to `WAVM` histories for Arbitrum based on an execution server. The validator client, described below, will have access to a state manager backend in order to make moves on challenge vertices.

- **Timers:** Each unrivaled edge (that is, an edge without another competing edge) will have a timer that _ticks up_. Time in the protocol is measured using blocks of the first non-Arbitrum ancestor chain (i.e., Ethereum blocks for L2 chains and L3 chains settling to an Arbitrum chain, and parent chain blocks for chains settling to a non-Arbitrum L2 chain), and block numbers are used. An edge's timer stops ticking when a rival edge is created onchain. We'll give a more detailed definition later, but two edges are considered rivals if they agree on some prefix of a computation starting from the same state but disagree on the remainder of that computation. Most importantly, timers are used to confirm assertions when an unrivaled edge's timer and associated assertion reaches the specified challenge period. See the section on [Timers and Edges](./bold-technical-deep-dive.mdx#timers) for more details.

- **Validating <a data-quicklook-from="bridge">bridge</a>:** The smart contract that leverages Ethereum's security and censorship-resistance to unlock bridged assets from the child chain back to the parent. Assets can be unlocked after an assertion (showing that those assets have been bridged from the child chain) has been posted and confirmed.

- **Validator client:** A validator client is software that knows the correct history of the Arbitrum child chain via a state manager backend and can create assertions on the parent chain about them by bonding a claim. A validator is also active in ensuring honest assertions get confirmed and participating in challenging those it disagrees with. In BoLD, an honest validator will also participate in challenges other validators are a part of to support other honest participants. It interacts with the onchain components via chain bindings described above.

- **Validator software:** Software that has knowledge of the correct Arbitrum child chain state at any point. It tracks the onchain rollup contracts for assertions posted and will automatically initiate challenges on malicious assertions if configured to do so by the user. It will participate in new and existing challenges and make moves as required by the protocol to win against any number of malicious entities. Its goals are to ensure only honest assertions about Arbitrum's state are confirmed on Ethereum, and that honest assertions always get confirmed on Ethereum in a timely manner (within at most two challenge periods). All Arbitrum full nodes are watchtower validators by default. This means they do not post claims or assertions unless configured to do so but will warn in case invalid assertions are detected onchain.

### How BoLD uses Ethereum

When it comes to implementing the protocol, BoLD needs to be deployed on a credibly-neutral, censorship-resistant backend to be fair to all participants. As such, Ethereum was chosen as the perfect candidate. Ethereum is currently the most decentralized, secure, smart contract <a data-quicklook-from="blockchain">blockchain</a> to which the full protocol can be deployed, with challenge moves performed as transactions to the protocol’s smart contracts.

A helpful mental model for understanding the system is that it uses Ethereum itself as the ultimate referee for deciding assertion results. Participants in the challenge protocol can disagree over the _results of child chain state transitions_ and provide proofs to the protocol's smart contracts on Ethereum to determine which result is correct. Because computation is deterministic, there will always be a single correct result.

_From the **[Nitro whitepaper](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/Nitro-whitepaper.pdf)**. Parent chain blocks are “settled to the parent chain” after a 6.4 day period has elapsed and nobody has challenged their validity on Ethereum._

In effect, there is a miniature Arbitrum state-transition VM [deployed as an Ethereum smart contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/osp/OneStepProofEntry.sol) to prove which assertions are correct. However, computation on Ethereum is expensive, which is why this mini-VM is built to handle “one-step proofs” consisting of a single step of WebAssembly (WASM) code. The Arbitrum state transition logic, written in Golang, is also compiled to WASM and will therefore obtain the same results as the VM found in the onchain smart contract. The soundness of the protocol depends on the assumptions that computation is deterministic and equivalent between the onchain VM and the Golang state transition compiled to WASM.

All actors in the protocol have a local state from which they can produce valid proofs, and all honest parties will have the same local state. Malicious entities, however, can deviate from the honest parties in attempts to confirm invalid states through the protocol. Both the protocol and the honest validator client’s job is then to allow honest parties to always win against any number of malicious participants by always claiming the absolute truth.

## Assertions

A key responsibility for Arbitrum proposers is to regularly post claims about the Arbitrum chains’ state to Ethereum at certain checkpoints. These are known as assertions (and are sometimes called child chain state roots). Assertions contain information, most critically:

1. The child chain block hash being claimed

2. A "history commitment" combining hashes of the chain's intermediate state after every block the assertion covers. This is essentially a Merkle-like data structure, a tree from which the asserter only needs to provide the root when posting the assertion.

3. The batch number it corresponds to for the Arbitrum chain

4. The number of messages in the Arbitrum <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer">Sequencer</a> inbox at the time the assertion is created

The following assertion to be posted onchain must consume the specified number of inbox messages from the previous assertion. There is a required delay measured in blocks of the first non-Arbitrum ancestor chain (i.e., Ethereum blocks for L2 chains and L3 chains settling to an Arbitrum chain, and parent chain blocks for chains settling to a non-Arbitrum L2 chain) for assertion posting. Currently, this value is set to equal one hour for BoLD.

Anyone can confirm assertions after a period of 6.4 days if they have not been challenged. In particular, assertions facilitate the process of withdrawing from Arbitrum back to Ethereum. Arbitrum withdrawals require specifying a blockhash, which must be confirmed as an assertion onchain. This is why withdrawals have a delay of 6.4 days if they are not actively challenged.

Validators must become proposers in the rollup contract before being allowed to post assertions. For <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> and <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a>, this involves placing a one-time bond of 3600 `WETH` that is locked in the contract until they choose to withdraw. Validators can only withdraw their bond if their latest posted assertion gets confirmed. Every assertion a validator posts will become their latest bonded assertion. Subsequent bonds are not needed to post more assertions, instead, the protocol “moves” a validator’s bonds to their latest posted assertion.

Assertions form a chain where there can be forks. For instance, a validator might disagree on the history commitment of block state hashes, which an assertion contains. All <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nitro">Arbitrum Nitro</a> nodes are configured to warn users if they observe an assertion they disagree with posted onchain. However, suppose a node is configured as a validator and has deposited a bond to the [`Rollup` contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol). In that case, that validator can post the correct rival assertion to any invalid one it just observed. The validator will also be able to initiate a challenge by posting a challenge bond and other data to the `ChallengeManager`, signaling it is disputing an assertion.

#### Overflow assertions

Given the mandatory delay of one hour between assertions posted onchain, and each assertion is a claim to a specific Arbitrum batch, there could be a very large number of blocks in between assertions. However, a single assertion only supports a maximum of 2^26 Arbitrum blocks since the previous assertion. If this value is overflowed, one or more follow-up overflow assertions needs to be posted to consume the rest of the blocks above the maximum. This overflow assertion will not be subject to the mandatory one-hour delay between assertions.

#### Trustless bonding pools

A large upfront assertion bond is critical for discouraging malicious actors from attacking Arbitrum and spamming the network (e.g., delay attacks), especially because malicious actors will always lose challenges and their entire bond. On the other hand, requiring such a high upfront assertion bond may be prohibitive for a single honest entity to put up—especially since the cost to defend Arbitrum is proportional to the number of malicious entities and ongoing challenges at any given point in time.

To address this, there is a [contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/contracts/src/assertionStakingPool/AssertionStakingPoolCreator.sol) that anyone can use to deploy a <a data-quicklook-from="trustless">trustless</a>, bonding (or staking) pool as a way of crowdsourcing funds from others who wish to help defend Arbitrum, but who may otherwise not individually be able to put up the sizeable upfront bond itself.

Anyone can deploy an assertion bonding pool using the `AssertionStakingPoolCreator.sol` contract as a means to crowdsource funds for bonding funds to an assertion. To defend Arbitrum using one of these pools, an entity would first deploy this pool with the assertion they believe is correct and wish to bond on to challenge an adversary's assertion. Then, anyone can verify that the claimed assertion is correct by running the inputs through their node's <a data-quicklook-from="state-transition-function">State Transition Function</a> (STF). If other parties agree that the assertion is correct, they can deposit their funds into the contract. When enough funds have been deposited, anyone can trigger the creation of the assertion onchain to start the challenge in a trustless manner. Finally, once the dispute protocol confirms the honest parties' assertion, all involved entities will get their funds reimbursed and can withdraw.

Note that with bonding pools, there is no minimum `WETH` requirement and once the entire bond amount is raised (either 3600, 555, or 79 `ETH` for Arbitrum One), then the assertion can be posted by anyone trustlessly. Additionally, there is an optional feature in the Nitro node validator software that enables both the automatic deployment of a bonding pool contract and depositing of funds to challenge an observed invalid assertion.

Trustless bonding pools can also be created to open challenges
and make moves on challenges without sacrificing decentralization.

### Opening challenges

To initiate a challenge, there must first be a fork in the assertion chain within the Arbitrum Rollup contracts. However, a challenge's actual start involves creating an edge claim and posting it to the `ChallengeManager` contract on the parent chain.

If there is a fork in the assertion chain (a "top-level" dispute), anyone can begin a challenge by creating a challenge edge. No bond is needed: each branch of the fork has a unique assertion, with an attached bond, and that assertion contains enough information to uniquely determine its challenge edge; that is, there is no "wiggle room" that an adversary can use to create multiple challenge edges from a single assertion (if this were possible, it could lead to spam attacks on the protocol).

Anyone can open a sub-challenge on an assertion without needing to be a bonder in the Rollup contract, so long as they post a challenge bond and an edge claiming intent to start the challenge. This challenge bond is much lower than the one required to become an assertion proposer. Challenges are not tied to specific addresses or parties - instead, anyone can participate.

Recall that a challenge is a fundamental disagreement about an assertion posted to the Arbitrum chain. At its core, validators essentially disagree about the blockhash at a certain block number, and the BoLD protocol allows them to interactively narrow down their disagreement via fraud proofs such that Ethereum can be the final referee and claim a winner.

At its core, the disagreement between validators looks something like this:

- Common parent assertion: `batch 5, blockhash 0xabc`

- Alice’s assertion: `batch 10, blockhash 0x123`

- Bob’s assertion: `batch 10, blockhash 0x456`

Their disagreement is about an Arbitrum block somewhere between batch 5 and batch 10. Here’s how the actual challenge begins in this example:

Validators have to fetch all blocks between batch 5 and batch 10 and create a Merkle commitment out of them as a Merkle tree with 2^26+1 leaves. If there are fewer than 2^26 blocks in between the assertions, the last block is repeated to pad the leaves of the tree to that value. Validators then create an “edge” data structure, which contains the following fields:

- **start_hash:** the start_hash of the claimed assertion and is also the end_hash of the previous assertion

- **end_hash:** the end hash of the last block in the child assertion that a validator claims is correct.

- **merkle_root:** the Merkle root that results from committing to a Merkle tree from the start block hash to the end block hash

- **inclusion_proofs:** Merkle proofs that the end hashes are indeed leaves of the Merkle tree committing to a root

The concept of a history commitment is at the core of challenges and BoLD itself.

The validators above provide a Merkle proof of their commitment to some history. In this case, all the Arbitrum block hashes from batch 5 to batch 10. Using this tree, validators can narrow their disagreement to a single block using Merkle proofs by iteratively bisecting the Merkle root and creating edges which have their own history commitments to each half of the tree.

### Challenge resolution

The fundamental unit in a challenge is an edge data structure.

#### Initiation

The first validator to create an edge initiates a challenge. The smart contracts validate the Merkle inclusion proofs and hashes provided to prove this challenge is about a specific fork in the assertion chain in the Rollup contract.

#### Bisections

When an edge is created, it claims some history from point A to B, with which validators can agree or disagree. Other validators can claim some history from point A to B’, where B’ is a different end state. A history commitment is a Merkle commitment to a list of hashes.

To narrow down a disagreement, validators have to figure out what exact hash they disagree with. To do this, the game essentially takes turns between validators playing binary search. Each move here is known as a “bisection” because each move splits a history commitment in half.

For instance:

Alice commits to 33 hashes with start = A, end = B

Bob commits to 33 hashes with start = A, end = B’

Either of them can perform a “bisection” move on their edge. For instance, if Alice “bisects” her edge E, the bisection <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> will produce two children, E_1 and E_2. E_1 commits to 17 hashes from height A to B/2, and E_2 commits to 17 hashes from height B/2 to B.

A validator can make a bisection move on an edge as long as that edge is “rivaled”, meaning that there is another edge with a conflicting claim.

#### Sub-challenges

The number of steps of execution at which validators could disagree within a single Arbitrum block has a max of 2^42. To play a game of bisections on this amount of hashes would be unreasonable from a space requirement, as each history commitment would require 4.35Tb worth of hashes. Instead, BoLD plays the bisection game over different levels of granularity of this space of 2^42 hashes that we call sub-challenges that can be viewed as recursive execution of the dispute resolution process.

As a reminder, the bisection game is an iterative and interactive process. The first sub-challenge is at the block level and is where validators disagree over Arbitrum blocks between two assertions. The disagreeing validators create “edges” containing history commitments to all the blocks in between those two assertions, which is a max of 2^26 child chain blocks, and commence the bisection game. As they progressively narrow down to a single block of disagreement, the validators then begin the next phase of the challenge process by opening a sub-challenge over up to 2^19 **BigSteps**, which are each 2^23 steps of WASM execution. Once they reach a single disagreement at the BigStep level, they open a final sub-challenge over a maximum of 2^23 SmallSteps, which are each a single step of WASM execution. The bisection game is the same at each sub-challenge level, and opening a sub-challenge requires placing another “challenge bond”. The magnitudes of challenge bonds are different at each sub-challenge level.

#### One step proof

Once validators reach a single step of disagreement at the deepest sub-challenge level, they need to provide something called a **<a data-quicklook-from="one-step-proof">One Step Proof</a>**, or OSP for short. This is a proof of WASM execution showing that executing the Arbitrum state transition function at machine hash A leads to machine hash B. The parent chain, like Ethereum is for Arbitrum One, then actually runs a WASM emulator using a smart contract for this step and will declare a winner. An evil party cannot forge a one-step proof, and unless there is a critical bug in the smart contract, the honest party will always win. At this point, the honest party’s one-step proven edge will be confirmed, and the evil party has no more moves to make. Next, the honest party’s “branch” of edges all the way from the top to the one-step proven edge will have an ever-increasing timer until the top edge is confirmed by time.

#### Timers

Once a validator creates an edge, and if it does not have any rival edge contesting it, that edge will have a timer that ticks up called its **unrivaled timer**. Time in the protocol is measured in blocks of the first non-Arbitrum ancestor chain (i.e., Ethereum blocks for L2 chains and L3 chains settling to an Arbitrum chain, and parent chain blocks for chains settling to a non-Arbitrum L2 chain), and block numbers are used. An edge's timer stops ticking when a rival edge is created onchain.

Edges also have an **inherited timer**, which is the sum of its unrivaled timer + the minimum inherited timer of an edge's children (recursive definition). Once one of the top-level edges that initiated a challenge has achieved an inherited `timer >= a CHALLENGE_PERIOD (6.4 days)``, it can be confirmed. At this point, its assertion can also be confirmed as its associated challenge has completed. A minor but important detail is that edges also inherit the time their claimed assertion was unrivaled.

Feel free to read the [BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491) for more details around how timers are tracked.

#### Cached timer updates

An edge's "inherited timer" value exists onchain and can be updated via a transaction. Given it is a recursive definition, it can be updated via multiple transactions. First, the lowermost edges have their timers updated, then their parents, etc., up to the top. Validators can track information locally to avoid sending wasteful transactions and only propagate updates once they are confident their edge is confirmable by time.

#### Confirmation

Once an edge has a total onchain timer greater than or equal to a challenge period, it can be confirmed via a transaction. Not all edges need to be confirmed onchain, as simply the top-level block challenge edge is enough to confirm the claimed assertion and resolve a dispute. A challenge is not complete at the one-step proof. It is only complete once the claimed assertion of a challenge is confirmed by time.

### Bonding in challenges

To create a challenge, there must be a fork in the Arbitrum assertion chain smart contract. A validator that wishes to initiate a challenge must then post an “edge” claiming a history of block hashes from the previous assertion to the claimed assertion they believe is correct. To do so, they need to put up some value called a "challenge bond". Note that to open a new assertion-level challenge, no challenge bond needs to be posted. This is because top-level assertions already contain enough information to uniquely determine their corresponding challenge edge (which contain a hash of this history), and have already been bonded on.

Challenge bonds are named as such because they are bonds required
for opening challenges. The mechanism of how challenge bond economics are decided is contained in the
[Economics of Disputes](../../how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes.mdx), which also explains
the cost profile and spam prevention in BoLD. In short, the actual cost of a bond encompasses many costs
associated with participating in the dispute game. More information on the bond sizes and how they were
calculated can be found in the [Economics of Disputes](../../how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes.mdx)
document mentioned above.

Each sub-challenge that is created requires depositing a challenge bond. For Arbitrum One, the first unrivaled edge’s bond is kept in the challenge manager contract on Ethereum, while any subsequent rival bonds are kept in an excess bond receiver address. Once a challenge is complete, all bonds for an honest party are automatically refunded in-protocol while all confiscated bonds are sent to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. It is important to not offer the majority of the bonds confiscated from dishonest parties to honest parties to avoid perverse incentives, such as grieving attacks in self-challenges or to discourage needless competition between honest parties.

### Reimbursements of bonds

The reimbursement of assertion bonds and challenge bonds for honest parties will be handled “in-band” by the protocol. Please see [Economics of Disputes](../../how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes.mdx) for more information about this topic.

### Upgrade mechanism

For BoLD to be deployed on an Arbitrum chain, an upgrade admin action needs to be taken using an `UpgradeExecutor` pattern. This is a smart contract that executes actions as the rollup owner. At the upgrade, the `RollupCore.sol` contract will be updated to a new BoLD one, and additional contracts needed for BoLD challenges, such as an `EdgeChallengeManager.sol`, will also be deployed to the parent chain.

Next, assertions will then be posted to the new Rollup contract. During the upgrade period, there could have been a very large number of blocks posted in Arbitrum batches. For this purpose, BoLD assertions support the concept of an **overflow**, allowing us to efficiently handle this situation.

:::caution Withdrawals leading up to a BoLD upgrade

The confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to the parent chain, Ethereum, that were initiated _before_ the upgrade will be delayed by one challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively "resets" the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.

For example, if the upgrade happened at time _t_, then a withdrawal initiated at a time _t-2_ days will need to wait an additional _6.4_ days for their withdrawal to be finalized, totaling 8.4 days of maximum delay. Withdrawals that finalize before the upgrade takes place at time _t_ will be unaffected. In other words, the maximum delay a withdrawal will experience leading up to the upgrade is 12.8 days (two challenge periods).
:::

The upgrade pattern for an existing Arbitrum Rollup to a BoLD-enabled one is tested extensively and run as part of each of our pull requests in the BoLD repository [upgrade workflow on GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/c4e068b568ff662f49ed191c5c3188ea7b6138b2/.github/workflows/go.yml#L209).
