This section explores the various methods users can employ to submit transactions for inclusion on <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a>. We discuss the different pathways availableâ€”sending transactions to the <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer">sequencer</a>, or bypassing it by submitting transactions through the <a data-quicklook-from="delayed-inbox">Delayed Inbox</a> contract on the <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a>. By outlining these options, we aim to clarify how users can interact with Arbitrum, detail the processes involved in each method, and identify the modules responsible for handling these transactions. This overview will enhance your understanding of the initial steps in the Arbitrum ecosystem's <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> lifecycle and prepare you for a more detailed exploration of transaction inclusion mechanisms in subsequent sections.

This diagram illustrates the various pathways for submitting transactions to the Arbitrum chain. It highlights the options for sending transactions through the sequencer or bypassing it and using the Delayed Inbox contract on the parent chain.

## Submitting transactions to the Sequencer

This section outlines the different methods for users to submit transactions to the sequencer on the Arbitrum chain. There are four primary ways to do this: Public RPC, Third-Party RPCs, Arbitrum Nodes, and the Sequencer Endpoint. We will explore these methods in detail, explaining when to choose one over the other and how to use each to effectively submit transactions to the Arbitrum sequencer.

### 1. Public RPC
Arbitrum provides public RPCs for its primary chains: <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a>, <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a>, and Arbitrum Sepolia. Due to their rate-limited nature, these RPC endpoints are suitable for less resource-intensive operations. Public RPCs can be a viable option for general use cases and lightweight interactions with the network.

For more details on the specific RPC endpoints for each chain, refer to the [Arbitrum Public RPC Endpoints page](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#arbitrum-public-rpc-endpoints).

### 2. Third-Party RPC

Users also have the option to interact with Arbitrum's public chains using third-party node providers. These providers are often the same popular ones used for Ethereum, making them reliable choices for resource-intensive operations. We recommend using these third-party providers when performance and scalability are critical.

You can find a list of supported [third-party RPC providers on this page](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#third-party-rpc-providers).

### 3. Arbitrum Nodes

Another approach for sending transactions to the sequencer is through self-hosted Arbitrum nodes. Running a node gives you direct control over your transactions, which go to the sequencer via the <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer-feed">Sequencer Feed</a>.

Refer to the [Arbitrum Node documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/overview) to learn more about setting up and running a node.

### 4. Sequencer Endpoint

The Sequencer Endpoint is the most direct method for users looking to minimize delays in their transactions reaching the sequencer. Unlike standard RPC URLs, the Sequencer Endpoint supports only `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` calls, bypassing the load balancer entirely. This endpoint makes it an optimal choice for users who require the quickest transaction processing time.

The diagram below shows different ways to submit transactions to the Sequencer:

## Bypassing the Sequencer

This section explores an alternative method for submitting transactions to the Arbitrum chain, which bypasses the sequencer. This page focuses on how users can send their transactions directly to the Delayed Inbox contract on the parent chain rather than through the sequencer. This method offers two distinct paths a transaction can take, with each route interacting with the network differently to achieve transaction inclusion. This approach provides users with greater flexibility, ensuring that transactions can still be processed even if the sequencer is unavailable or users choose not to rely on it. This section highlights these alternative submission mechanisms and underscores the robustness and decentralization features inherent in the Arbitrum network.

In **Diagram 3**, we demonstrate how users can submit their transactions using the Delayed Inbox contract to bypass the sequencer. As illustrated in the diagram, there are two possible paths for transaction handling. When a transaction gets submitted to the Delayed Inbox, the sequencer may automatically pick it up, include it as an ordered transaction, and send it to the Sequencer feed. However, if the sequencer does not process the transaction within 24 hours, users have the reliable option to call the `forceInclude` function on the `SequencerInbox` contract. This action ensures that the sequencer picks up the transaction and includes it in the ordered transaction list, providing users with confidence in their transactions.

To send a transaction to the Delayed Inbox instead of submitting it to the sequencer, users can construct their transaction and then call the [`sendL2Message`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol#L150) function, passing the serialized, signed transaction data as an argument. This function allows users to send a generic child chain message to the chain, suitable for any message that does not require parent chain validation.

If the sequencer is not back online within 24 hours or decides to censor the transaction, users can invoke the [`forceInclusion`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L284) function on the `SequencerInbox` contract. This action ensures their transaction is included on the chain, bypassing the sequencer's role.

Additionally, the Arbitrum SDK provides the [`InboxTools`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/792a7ee3ccf09842653bc49b771671706894cbb4/src/lib/inbox/inbox.ts#L64C14-L64C24) class, which simplifies the process of submitting transactions to the Delayed Inbox. Users can utilize the [`sendChildSignedTx`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/792a7ee3ccf09842653bc49b771671706894cbb4/src/lib/inbox/inbox.ts#L401C16-L401C33) method to send the transaction and the [`forceInclude`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/792a7ee3ccf09842653bc49b771671706894cbb4/src/lib/inbox/inbox.ts#L367) method to ensure its inclusion. The SDK also offers helper methods like [`signChildTx`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/792a7ee3ccf09842653bc49b771671706894cbb4/src/lib/inbox/inbox.ts#L429) to assist with signing the transaction during the creation of the serialized signed transaction hex string, streamlining the entire process.
