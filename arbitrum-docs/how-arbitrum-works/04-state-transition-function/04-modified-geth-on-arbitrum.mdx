Nitro makes minimal modifications to <a data-quicklook-from="geth">Geth</a> in hopes of not violating its assumptions. This section will explore the relationship between Geth and <a data-quicklook-from="arbos">ArbOS</a>, which consists of a series of hooks, interface implementations, and strategic re-appropriations of Geth's basic types.

We store ArbOS's state at an address inside a Geth `statedb`. In doing so, ArbOS inherits the `statedb`'s statefulness and lifetime properties. For example, a <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a>'s direct state changes to ArbOS would get discarded upon a revert.

`0xA4B05FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` is a fictional account representing ArbOS.

For a complete list of hooks and their descriptions refer to [Hooks](/how-arbitrum-works/04-state-transition-function/07-hooks.mdx).
