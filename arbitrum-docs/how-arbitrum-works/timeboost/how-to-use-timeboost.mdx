Timeboost is a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum chains. With Timeboost, anyone can bid for the right to access an express lane on the **Sequencer** faster transaction inclusion.

In this how-to, you'll learn how to bid for the right to use the express lane and submit transactions through the express lane. To learn more about Timeboost and the key terms used on this page, refer to the [gentle introduction](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx).

This how-to assumes that you're familiar with the following:

- [How Timeboost works](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx)
- [viem](https://viem.sh/), since the snippets of code present in the how-to use this library

::::info Note about transferring express lane rights

Please note that in the initial release of Timeboost, transferring of express lane control via the either the `setTransferor` or the `transferExpressLaneController` will not be supported by the Arbitrum Nitro node software in the initial launch and may be implemented at a future date via a regular node upgrade. Calls made to these two functions on the auction contract will be successful, but actual transfer of the rights will not be recognized by the node software (including the Sequencer).

A round's express lane controller, at their choice, can still send transactions signed by others on a per-transaction basis, as explained later in this guide.

::::

## How to submit bids for the right to be the express lane controller

To use the express lane for faster transaction inclusion, you must win an auction for the right to be the express lane controller for a specific round.

::::info

Remember that, by default, each round lasts 60 seconds, and the auction for a specific round closes 15 seconds before the round starts. These default values can be configured on a chain using the `roundDurationSeconds` and `auctionClosingSeconds` parameters.

::::

Auctions are facilitated by an auction contract, and bids get submitted to an autonomous auctioneer that interact with the contract. Let's look at the process of submitting bids and finding out the winner of an auction.

### Prerequisites: Gather the required information

import { AddressExplorerLink as AEL } from '@site/src/components/AddressExplorerLink';

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Address of the auction contract
- Endpoint of the autonomous auctioneer

The following table shows this information for the Arbitrum DAO-owned chains:

#### Table 1: Timeboost reference URLs and addresses

| Network          | Auction contract                                                              | Autonomous auctioneer endpoint             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | <AEL address="0x991DbEDf388CB5925318f06362D4fCa7b040527D" chainID={421614} /> | https://arbsepolia-auctioneer.arbitrum.io/ |
| Arbitrum One     | <AEL address="0x5fcb496a31b7AE91e7c9078Ec662bd7A55cd3079" chainID={42161} />  | Pending on-chain governance vote           |
| Arbitrum Nova    | <AEL address="0xa5aBADAF73DFcf5261C7f55420418736707Dc0db" chainID={42170} />  | Pending on-chain governance vote           |

### Step 1: Deposit funds into the auction contract

Before bidding on an auction, we need to deposit funds in the auction contract. These funds are deposited in the form of the `ERC-20` token used to bid, also known as the `bidding token`. We will be able to bid for an amount that is equal to or less than the tokens we have deposited in the auction contract.

To see the amount of tokens we have deposited in the auction contract, we can call the function `balanceOf` in the `Auction` contract:

```tsx
const depositedBalance = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  args: [userAddress],
});
console.log(`Current balance of ${userAddress} in auction contract: ${depositedBalance}`);
```

If we want to deposit more funds to the `Auction` contract, we first need to know what the bidding token is. To obtain the address of the bidding token, we can call the function `biddingToken` in the `Auction` contract:

```tsx
const biddingTokenContractAddress = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'biddingToken',
});
console.log(`biddingToken: ${biddingTokenContractAddress}`);
```

::::info Bidding token in Arbitrum chains

On Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the default bidding token is `WETH`.

::::

Once we know what the bidding token is, we can deposit funds to the auction contract by calling the function `deposit` of the contract after having it approved as spender of the amount we want to deposit:

```tsx
// Approving spending tokens
const approveHash = await walletClient.writeContract({
  account,
  address: biddingTokenContractAddress,
  abi: parseAbi(['function approve(address,uint256)']),
  functionName: 'approve',
  args: [auctionContract, amountToDeposit],
});
console.log(`Approve transaction sent: ${approveHash}`);

// Making the deposit
const depositHash = await walletClient.writeContract({
  account,
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'deposit',
  args: [amountToDeposit],
});
console.log(`Deposit transaction sent: ${depositHash}`);
```

### Step 2: submit bids

Once we have deposited funds into the auction contract, we can submit bids for the current auction round.

We can obtain the current round by calling the function `currentRound` in the `Auction` contract:

```tsx
const currentRound = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'currentRound',
});
console.log(`Current round: ${currentRound}`);
```

The above shows the current round that's running. At the same time, the auction for the next round might be open. For example, if the `currentRound` is 10, the auction for round 11 is happening right now. To check whether or not that auction is open, we can call the function `isAuctionRoundClosed` of the `Auction` contract:

```tsx
let currentAuctionRoundIsClosed = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'isAuctionRoundClosed',
});
```

:::note

Remember that, by default, auctions for a given round open 60 seconds before that round starts and close 15 seconds before the round starts, so there might be no auctions opened at certain times.

:::

Once we know what is the current round we can bid for (`currentRound + 1`) and we have verified that the auction is still open (`!currentAuctionRoundIsClosed`), we can submit a bid.

Bids are submitted to the autonomous auctioneer endpoint. We need to send a `auctioneer_submitBid` request with the following information:

- chain id
- address of the express lane controller candidate (for example, our address if we want to be the express lane controller)
- address of the auction contract
- round we are bidding for (in our example, `currentRound + 1`)
- amount in `wei` of the deposit `ERC-20` token to bid
- signature (explained below)

::::info Minimum reserve price

The amount to bid must be above the minimum reserve price at the moment you are bidding. This parameter is configurable per chain. You can obtain the minimum reserve price by calling the method `minReservePrice()(uint256)` in the `Auction` contract.

::::

Let's see an example of a call to this RPC method:

```tsx
const currentAuctionRound = currentRound + 1;
const hexChainId: `0x${string}` = `0x${Number(publicClient.chain.id).toString(16)}`;

const res = await fetch(<AUTONOMOUS_AUCTIONEER_ENDPOINT>, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 'submit-bid',
    method: 'auctioneer_submitBid',
    params: [
      {
        chainId: hexChainId,
        expressLaneController: userAddress,
        auctionContractAddress: auctionContractAddress,
        round: `0x${currentAuctionRound.toString(16)}`,
        amount: `0x${Number(amountToBid).toString(16)}`,
        signature: signature,
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

The signature that needs to be sent is an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature over the following typed structure data:

- Domain: `Bid(uint64 round,address expressLaneController,uint256 amount)`
- `round`: auction round number
- `expressLaneController`: address of the express lane controller candidate
- `amount`: amount to bid

Here's an example to produce that signature with viem:

```tsx
const currentAuctionRound = currentRound + 1;

const signatureData = hashTypedData({
  domain: {
    name: 'ExpressLaneAuction',
    version: '1',
    chainId: Number(publicClient.chain.id),
    verifyingContract: auctionContractAddress,
  },
  types: {
    Bid: [
      { name: 'round', type: 'uint64' },
      { name: 'expressLaneController', type: 'address' },
      { name: 'amount', type: 'uint256' },
    ],
  },
  primaryType: 'Bid',
  message: {
    round: currentAuctionRound,
    expressLaneController: userAddress,
    amount: amountToBid,
  },
});
const signature = await account.sign({
  hash: signatureData,
});
```

::::info

You can also call the function `getBidHash` in the auction contract to obtain the `signatureData`, specifying the `round`, `userAddress` and `amountToBid`.

::::

When sending the request, the autonomous auctioneer will return an empty result with an HTTP status `200` if received correctly. If the result returned contains an error message, it means that something went wrong. Following are some of the error messages that can help us understand what's happening:

#### Table 2: Errors relating to bid submission

| Error                   | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MALFORMED_DATA`        | Wrong input data, failed to deserialize, missing certain fields, etc.                                       |
| `NOT_DEPOSITOR`         | The address is not an active depositor in the auction contract                                              |
| `WRONG_CHAIN_ID`        | Wrong chain id for the target chain                                                                         |
| `WRONG_SIGNATURE`       | Signature failed to verify                                                                                  |
| `BAD_ROUND_NUMBER`      | Incorrect round, such as one from the past                                                                  |
| `RESERVE_PRICE_NOT_MET` | Bid amount does not meet the minimum required reserve price onchain                                         |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`  | The bid amount specified in the request is higher than the deposit balance of the depositor in the contract |

### Step 3: find out the winner of the auction

After the auction closes and before the round starts, the autonomous auctioneer will call the auction contract with the two highest bids received so the contract can declare the winner and subtract the second-highest bid from the winner's deposited funds. After this, the contract will emit an event with the new express lane controller address.

We can use this event to determine whether or not we've won the auction. The event signature is:

```solidity
event SetExpressLaneController(
    uint64 round,
    address indexed previousExpressLaneController,
    address indexed newExpressLaneController,
    address indexed transferor,
    uint64 startTimestamp,
    uint64 endTimestamp
);
```

Here's an example to get the log from the auction contract to determine the new express lane controller:

```tsx
const fromBlock = <any recent block, for example during the auction>
const logs = await publicClient.getLogs({
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  event: auctionContractAbi.filter((abiEntry) => abiEntry.name === 'SetExpressLaneController')[0],
  fromBlock,
});

const newExpressLaneController = logs[0].args.newExpressLaneController;
console.log(`New express lane controller: ${newExpressLaneController}`);
```

If you won the auction, congratulations! You are the express lane controller for the next round, which, by default, will start 15 seconds after the auction closes. The following section explains how we can submit a transaction to the express lane.

## How to submit transactions to the express lane

The Sequencer immediately sequences transactions sent to the express lane, while regular transactions are delayed 200ms by default. However, only the express lane controller can send transactions to the express lane. The previous section explained how to participate in the auction as the express lane controller for a given round.

The express lane is handled by the sequencer, so transactions are sent to the Sequencer endpoint. We need to send a `timeboost_sendExpressLaneTransaction` request with the following information:

- chain id
- current round (following the example above, `currentRound`)
- address of the auction contract
- sequence number: a per-round nonce of express lane submissions, which is reset to 0 at the beginning of each round
- RLP encoded transaction payload
- conditional options for Arbitrum transactions ([more information](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/48de2030c7a6fa8689bc0a0212ebca2a0c73e3ad/arbitrum_types/txoptions.go#L71))
- signature (explained below)

::::info Timeboost-ing third party transactions

Notice that while the express lane controller must sign the `timeboost_sendExpressLaneTransaction` request, the actual transaction to be executed can be signed by any party. In other words, the express lane controller can receive transactions signed by other parties and sign them to apply the time advantage offered by the express lane to those transactions.

::::

::::info Support for `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional`

Timeboost doesn't currently support the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` method.

::::

Let's see an example of a call to this RPC method:

```tsx
const hexChainId: `0x${string}` = `0x${Number(publicClient.chain.id).toString(16)}`;

const transaction = await walletClient.prepareTransactionRequest(...);
const serializedTransaction = await walletClient.signTransaction(transaction);

const res = await fetch(<SEQUENCER_ENDPOINT>, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 'express-lane-tx',
    method: 'timeboost_sendExpressLaneTransaction',
    params: [
      {
        chainId: hexChainId,
        round: `0x${currentRound.toString(16)}`,
        auctionContractAddress: auctionContractAddress,
        sequence: `0x${sequenceNumber.toString(16)}`,
        transaction: serializedTransaction,
        options: {},
        signature: signature,
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

The signature that needs to be sent is an Ethereum signature over the bytes encoding of the following information:

- Hash of `keccak256("TIMEBOOST_BID")`
- Chain id in hexadecimal, padded to 32 bytes
- Auction contract address
- Round number in hexadecimal, padded to 8 bytes
- Sequence number in hexadecimal, padded to 8 bytes
- Serialized transaction

Here's an example to produce that signature:

```tsx
const hexChainId: `0x${string}` = `0x${Number(publicClient.chain.id).toString(16)}`;

const transaction = await walletClient.prepareTransactionRequest(...);
const serializedTransaction = await walletClient.signTransaction(transaction);

const signatureData = concat([
  keccak256(toHex('TIMEBOOST_BID')),
  pad(hexChainId),
  auctionContract,
  toHex(numberToBytes(currentRound, { size: 8 })),
  toHex(numberToBytes(sequenceNumber, { size: 8 })),
  serializedTransaction,
]);
const signature = await account.signMessage({
  message: { raw: signatureData },
});
```

When sending the request, the sequencer will return an empty result with an HTTP status `200` if it received it correctly. If the result returned contains an error message, something went wrong. Following are some of the error messages that can help us understand what's happening:

#### Table 3: Errors relating to express lane transaction submission

Note that if you get any of the errors below, then the sequence number used in your express lane transaction was _not_ consumed.
| Error | Description |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MALFORMED_DATA` | wrong input data, failed to deserialize, missing certain fields, etc. |
| `WRONG_CHAIN_ID` | wrong chain id for the target chain |
| `WRONG_SIGNATURE` | signature failed to verify |
| `BAD_ROUND_NUMBER` | incorrect round, such as one from the past |
| `NOT_EXPRESS_LANE_CONTROLLER` | the sender is not the express lane controller |
| `NO_ONCHAIN_CONTROLLER` | there is no defined, on-chain express lane controller for the round |
| `SEQUENCE_NUMBER_ALREADY_SEEN` | the sequence number used for the given transaction was already consumed, try resubmitting with a new sequence number |
| `SEQUENCE_NUMBER_TOO_LOW` | the sequencer number used for the given transaction is numerically lower than the expeected sequence number, try resubmitting with the expected sequence number
| `sequence number has reached max allowed limit` | the limit on the number of buffered express lane transactions was reached. Read more about this on our [Troubleshoot Timeboost page](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/troubleshoot-timeboost.mdx#the-block-based-timeout-for-express-lane-transactions) |

::::info What happens if you're not the express lane controller?

If you are not the express lane controller and you try to submit a transaction to the express lane, the sequencer will respond with the error `NOT_EXPRESS_LANE_CONTROLLER` or `NO_ONCHAIN_CONTROLLER`.

::::

<!--

## How to transfer the right to use the express lane to someone else

If you are the express lane controller, you also have the right to transfer the right to use the express lane to someone else.

To do that, you can call the function `transferExpressLaneController` in the auction contract:

```tsx
const transferELCTransaction = await walletClient.writeContract({
  currentELCAccount,
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'transferExpressLaneController',
  args: [currentRound, newELCAddress],
});
console.log(`Transfer EL controller transaction hash: ${transferELCTransaction}`);
```

From that moment, the previous express lane controller will not be able to send new transactions to the express lane.

### Setting a transferor account

A `transferor` is an address with the right to transfer express lane controller rights on behalf of the express lane controller. This function (`setTransferor`) ensures that the express lane controller has a way of nominating an address that can transfer rights to anyone they see fit to improve the user experience of reselling/transferring the control of the express lane.

We can set a transferor for our account using the auction contract. Additionally, we can fix that transferor account until a specific round to guarantee other parties that we will not change the transferor until the specified round finishes.

To set a transferor, we can call the function `setTransferor` in the auction contract:

```tsx
// Fixing the transferor for 10 rounds
const fixedUntilRound = currentRound + 10n;

const setTransferorTransaction = await walletClient.writeContract({
  currentELCAccount,
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'setTransferor',
  args: [
    {
      addr: transferorAddress,
      fixedUntilRound: fixedUntilRound,
    },
  ],
});
console.log(`Set transferor transaction hash: ${setTransferorTransaction}`);
```

From that moment on (until the transferor is changed or disabled), the transferor will be able to call `transferExpressLaneController` while the express lane controller is `currentELCAccount` to transfer the rights to use the express lane to a different account.

-->

## How to withdraw funds deposited in the auction contract

Funds are deposited in the auction contract to have the right to bid in auctions. Withdrawing funds is possible through two steps: initiate withdrawal, wait for two rounds, and finalize withdrawal.

To initiate a withdrawal, we can call the function `initiateWithdrawal` in the `Auction` contract:

```tsx
const initWithdrawalTransaction = await walletClient.writeContract({
  account,
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'initiateWithdrawal',
});
console.log(`Initiate withdrawal transaction sent: ${initWithdrawalTransaction}`);
```

This transaction will initiate a withdrawal of all funds deposited by the sender account. When executing it, the contract will emit a `WithdrawalInitiated` event, with the following structure:

```solidity
event WithdrawalInitiated(
    address indexed account,
    uint256 withdrawalAmount,
    uint256 roundWithdrawable
);
```

In this event, `account` refers to the address whose funds are being withdrawn, `withdrawalAmount` refers to the amount being withdrawn from the contract, and `roundWithdrawable` refers to the round at which the withdrawal can be finalized.

After two rounds have passed, we can call the method `finalizeWithdrawal` in the `Auction` contract to finalize the withdrawal:

```tsx
const finalizeWithdrawalTransaction = await walletClient.writeContract({
  account,
  address: auctionContractAddress,
  abi: auctionContractAbi,
  functionName: 'finalizeWithdrawal',
});
console.log(`Finalize withdrawal transaction sent: ${finalizeWithdrawalTransaction}`);
```

## How to identify timeboosted transactions

Transactions sent to the express lane by the express lane controller and that have been executed (regardless of them being successful or having reverted) can be identified by looking at their receipts or the message broadcasted by the Sequencer feed.

Transaction receipts include now a new field `timeboosted`, which will be `true` for timeboosted transactions, and `false` for regular non-timeboosted transactions. For example:

```shell
blockHash               0x56325449149b362d4ace3267681c3c90823f1e5c26ccc4df4386be023f563eb6

l1BlockNumber           "0x6e8b49"
timeboosted             true
```

In the sequencer feed, the `BroadcastFeedMessage` struct now contains a `blockMetadata` field that represents whether a particular transaction in the block was timeboosted or not. The field blockMetadata is an array of bytes and it starts with a byte representing the version (`0`), followed by `ceil(N/8)` number of bytes where `N` is the number of transactions in the block. If a particular transaction was timeboosted, the bit representing its position in the block will be set to `1`, while the rest will be set to `0`. For example, if the `blockMetadata` of a particular message, viewed as bits is `00000000 01100000`, then the 2nd and 3rd transactions in that block were timeboosted.

## How to view historical bid data

In the current implementation, information about the winning bid for a resolved auction is emitted via the `AuctionResolved` event ([sample interface](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/express-lane-auction/IExpressLaneAuction.sol#L95-L103)). Historical bid information, including the round number and bid amounts, are published to a public S3 bucket at a regular cadence. Teams can use the URLs below to download the data:

#### Table 4: S3 URLs for historical bid data

| Chain            | S3 bucket URL                                                   |
