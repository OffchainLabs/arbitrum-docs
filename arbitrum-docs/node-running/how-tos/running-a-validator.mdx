Some Arbitrum nodes will choose to act as validators. This means that they watch the progress of the rollup protocol and perhaps also participate in that protocol to advance the state of the chain securely.
Not all nodes will choose to do this. Because the rollup protocol doesn’t decide what the chain will do but merely confirms the correct behavior that is fully determined by the inbox messages, a node can ignore the rollup protocol and simply compute for itself the correct behavior.
Here we describe different types of validators and provide instructions on how to run them.

### Types of validators

- Currently, the ability to post assertions on-chain for mainnet Arbitrum chains is whitelisted. However, anyone can run a validator in `Watchtower` mode which will immediately log an error if an on-chain assertion deviates from the locally computed chain state
- Full list of validator strategies:
  - `Watchtower`
    - If local state disagrees with on-chain assertion, simply log an error (no wallet required, gas never spent on-chain)
  - `Defensive` (Whitelist required)
    - Post stake and create challenge if local state disagrees with on-chain assertion (wallet required, will only post stake on-chain if bad assertion found)
  - `StakeLatest` (Whitelist required)
    - Stay staked on latest assertion and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time new assertion created)
  - `ResolveNodes` (Whitelist required)
    - Stay staked on latest assertion, resolve any unconfirmed assertions and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time unconfirmed assertion resolved or new assertion created)
  - `MakeNodes` (Whitelist required)
    - Continuously create new assertions, challenging any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, most expensive node to run)
    - Note that if there is more than one `MakeNodes` validator running, they might all try to create a new assertion at same time. In that case, only one will be successful, and the others will have still spent gas on reverted calls that didn't do anything.

### Running Watchtower validator

- Running a validator in `Watchtower` mode is the same as running a Nitro node with `--node.staker.enable --node.staker.strategy=Watchtower`
- Here is an example of how to run a watchtower validator for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum @latestNitroNodeImage@ --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.staker.enable --node.staker.strategy=Watchtower
  ```
- If a deviation is detected, a validator in Watchtower mode will log an error containing the string `found incorrect assertion in watchtower mode`
- To verify validator is working, this log line shows the wallet is setup correctly:
  ```shell
  INFO [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator                     txSender=nil actingAsWallet=nil whitelisted=false strategy=Watchtower
  ```
  - `strategy` should be `Watchtower`
  - The log line `validation succeeded` shows that the L2 block validator is working
  - The log line `found correct assertion` shows that the L1 validator is working

### Creating wallet for whitelisted validator

- Watchtower validators never need a wallet, because they never post on-chain
- Defensive validators need a wallet configured, but the wallet does not need to be funded until it logs that an assertion has been found
- All other validators require a funded wallet to immediately post stake, as well as additional funds that will be spent at regular intervals
- Here is an example of how to tell Nitro to create validator wallet for Arbitrum One and exit:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum @latestNitroNodeImage@ --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.staker.enable --l1.wallet.only-create-key --l1.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
  ```
- Wallet file will be created under the mounted directory inside the `arb1/wallet/` directory for Arb1, or `nova/wallet/` directory for Nova. Be sure to backup the wallet, it will be the only way to withdraw stake when desired

### Running whitelisted defensive validator

- A defensive validator requires that a wallet has already been created using the above steps
- Defensive validator wallets do not need to be funded initially
- If a defensive validator detects a deviation, it will log `bringing defensive validator online because of incorrect assertion`, and wait for funds to be added to wallet so stake can be posted and a dispute created
- Here is an example of how to run a whitelisted defensive validator for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum @latestNitroNodeImage@ --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.staker.enable --node.staker.strategy=Defensive --l1.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
  ```
- To verify validator is working, this log line shows the wallet is setup correctly:
  ```shell
  INFO [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator                     txSender=0x... actingAsWallet=0x... whitelisted=true strategy=Defensive
  ```
  - `whitelisted` should be `true` after your wallet has been added to whitelist
  - `strategy` should be `Defensive`
  - `txSender` and `actingAsWallet` should both be present and not `nil`
  - The log line `validation succeeded` shows that the L2 block validator is working
  - The log line `found correct assertion` shows that the L1 validator is working
