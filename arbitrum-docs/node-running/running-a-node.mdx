# Running a Node

Note: If you’re interested in accessing an Arbitrum chain, but you don’t want to set up your own node, see our [Node Providers](./node-providers.mdx) to get RPC access to fully-managed nodes hosted by a third party provider

### Minimum Hardware Configuration

- Followings specify the minimum hardware configuration required to setup a Nitro full node (not archival):
  - RAM: 4-8 GB
  - CPU: 2-4 core CPU (For AWS: t3 xLarge)
  - Storage: Minimum 1.2TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)
  - Estimated Growth Rate: around 3 GB per day

❗️Note: The minimum storage requirements will change over time as the Nitro chain grows. It is recommended to use more than the minimum requirements to run a robust full node.

### Required Artifacts

- Latest Docker Image: `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`

- Arbitrum One Nitro Genesis Database Snapshot

  - Use the parameter `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"` on first startup to initialize Nitro database
  - If running more than one node, easiest to manually download image from https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar and host it locally for your nodes
  - Or use `--init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar"` to use a local snapshot archive
  - sha256 checksum: `a609773c6103435b8a04d32c63f42bb5fa0dc8fc38a2acee4d2ab2d05880205c`
  - size: 33.5573504 GB

- Other chains do not have classic blocks, and do not require an initial genesis database

### Required parameter

- `--l1.url=<Layer 1 Ethereum RPC URL>`
  - Must provide standard layer 1 node RPC endpoint that you run yourself or from a node provider
- `--l2.chain-id=<L2 Chain ID>`
  - See [public chains](../public-chains.mdx) for a list of Arbitrum chains and the respective L2 Chain Ids

### Important ports

- RPC: `8547`
- Sequencer Feed: `9642`
- WebSocket: `8548`
  - WS port `8548` needs extra args to be opened. Please use these flags:
    - --ws.port=8548
    - --ws.addr=0.0.0.0
    - --ws.origins=\*

### Putting it all together

- When running docker image, an external volume should be mounted to persist the database across restarts. The mount point inside the docker image should be `/home/user/.arbitrum`
- Here is an example of how to run nitro-node:

  - Note that is important that `/some/local/dir/arbitrum` already exists, otherwise the directory might be created with `root` as owner, and the docker container won't be able to write to it

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url https://l1-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=<L2ChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
  ```

  - Note that if you are running L1 node on localhost, you may need to add `--network host` right after `docker run` to use docker host-based networking

  - When shutting down docker image, it is important to allow for a graceful shutdown so that the current state can be saved to disk. Here is an example of how to do a graceful shutdown of all docker images currently running

  ```shell
  docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
  ```

### Note on permissions

- The Docker image is configured to run as non-root UID 1000. This means if you are running in Linux or OSX and you are getting permission errors when trying to run the docker image, run this command to allow all users to update the persistent folders
  ```shell
  mkdir /data/arbitrum
  chmod -fR 777 /data/arbitrum
  ```

### Optional parameters

- `--init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar`
  - URL to download genesis database from. Only needed when starting Arbitrum One without database
- `--node.rpc.classic-redirect=<classic node RPC>`
  - If set, will redirect archive requests for pre-nitro blocks to the designated RPC, which should be an Arbitrum Classic node with archive database. Only valid for Arbitrum One.
- `--http.api`
  - APIs offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default `net,web3,eth`)
  - Add `debug` to enable tracing
- `--http.corsdomain`
  - Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
- `--http.vhosts`
  - Comma separated list of virtual hostnames from which to accept requests (server enforced). Accepts `*` wildcard (default `localhost`)
- `--http.addr`
  - Address to bind RPC to. May need to be set to `0.0.0.0` for docker networking to work properly
- `--node.caching.archive`
  - Retain past block state
- `--node.feed.input.url=<feed address>`
  - Defaults to `wss://<chainName>.arbitrum.io/feed`. If running more than a couple nodes, you will want to provide one feed relay per datacenter, see further instructions below
- `--node.forwarding-target=<sequencer RPC>`
  - Defaults to appropriate L2 Sequencer RPC depending on L1 and L2 chain IDs provided
- `--node.rpc.evm-timeout`
  - Defaults to `5s`, timeout used for `eth_call` (0 == no timeout)
- `--node.rpc.gas-cap`
  - Defaults to `50000000`, cap on computation gas that can be used in `eth_call`/`estimateGas` (0 = no cap)
- `--node.rpc.tx-fee-cap`
  - Defaults to `1`, cap on transaction fee (in ether) that can be sent via the RPC APIs (0 = no cap)

### Feed Relay

- When running more than one node, you want to run a single feed relay per datacenter, which will reduce ingress fees and improve stability
- The feed relay is in the same docker image
- Here is an example of how to run the feed relay for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed --l2.chain-id=42161
  ```
- Here is an example of how to run nitro-node for Arbitrum One with custom relay:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642
  ```

### Types of Validators

- Currently, the ability to post assertions on-chain for mainnet Arbitrum chains is whitelisted. However, anyone can run a validator in `Watchtower` mode which will immediately log an error if an on-chain assertion deviates from the locally computed chain state
- Full list of validator strategies:
  - `Watchtower`
    - If local state disagrees with on-chain assertion, simply log an error (no wallet required, gas never spent on-chain)
  - `Defensive` (Whitelist required)
    - Post stake and create challenge if local state disagrees with on-chain assertion (wallet required, will only post stake on-chain if bad assertion found)
  - `StakeLatest` (Whitelist required)
    - Stay staked on latest assertion and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time new assertion created)
  - `ResolveNodes` (Whitelist required)
    - Stay staked on latest assertion, resolve any unconfirmed assertions and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time unconfirmed assertion resolved or new assertion created)
  - `MakeNodes` (Whitelist required)
    - Continuously create new assertions, challenging any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, most expensive node to run)
    - Note that if there is more than one `MakeNodes` validator running, they might all try to create a new assertion at same time. In that case, only one will be successful, and the others will have still spent gas on reverted call that didn't do anything.

### Running Watchtower Validator

- Running a validator in `Watchtower` mode is the same as running a Nitro node with `--node.validator.enable --node.validator.strategy=Watchtower`
- Here is an example of how to run a watchtower validator for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.validator.enable --node.validator.strategy=Watchtower
  ```
- If a deviation is detected, a validator in Watchtower mode will log an error containing the string `found incorrect assertion in watchtower mode`
- To verify validator is working, this log line shows the wallet is setup correctly:
  ```shell
  INFO [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator                     txSender=nil actingAsWallet=nil whitelisted=false strategy=Watchtower
  ```
  - `strategy` should be `Watchtower`
  - The log line `validation succeeded` shows that the L2 block validator is working
  - The log line `found correct assertion` shows that the L1 validator is working

### Creating Wallet for Whitelisted Validator

- Watchtower validators never need a wallet, because they never post on-chain
- Defensive validators need a wallet configured, but the wallet does not need to be funded until it logs that an assertion has been found
- All other validators require a funded wallet to immediately post stake, as well as additional funds that will be spent at regular intervals
- Here is an example of how to tell Nitro to create validator wallet for Arbitrum One and exit:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.validator.enable --l1.wallet.only-create-key --l1.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
  ```
- Wallet file will be created under the mounted directory inside the `arb1/wallet/` directory for Arb1, or `nova/wallet/` directory for Nova. Be sure to backup the wallet, it will be the only way to withdraw stake when desired

### Running Whitelisted Defensive Validator

- A defensive validator requires that a wallet has already been created using the above steps
- Defensive validator wallets do not need to be funded initially
- If a defensive validator detects a deviation, it will log `bringing defensive validator online because of incorrect assertion`, and wait for funds to be added to wallet so stake can be posted and a dispute created
- Here is an example of how to run a whitelisted defensive validator for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.validator.enable --node.validator.strategy=Defensive --l1.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
  ```
- To verify validator is working, this log line shows the wallet is setup correctly:
  ```shell
  INFO [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator                     txSender=0x... actingAsWallet=0x... whitelisted=true strategy=Defensive
  ```
  - `whitelisted` should be `true` after your wallet has been added to whitelist
  - `strategy` should be `Defensive`
  - `txSender` and `actingAsWallet` should both be present and not `nil`
  - The log line `validation succeeded` shows that the L2 block validator is working
  - The log line `found correct assertion` shows that the L1 validator is working
