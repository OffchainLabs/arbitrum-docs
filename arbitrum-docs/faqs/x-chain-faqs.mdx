# FAQs: Cross Chain Messaging

### How can I check the status of my cross chain message? {#q-xchain-status}

Visit https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/ to check the status of a cross chain message (and execute it, if applicable). You’ll need the transaction hash of the initiating transaction (i.e., the L1 transaction hash for an L1-to-L2 message, and the L2 transaction hash for an L2-to-L1 message).

### When I initiate withdrawal from Arbitrum, how long does it take before I receive my funds? {#q-withdrawal-time}

It will typically be _roughly_ one week.

There's some variability in the exact wall-clock time of the dispute window, plus there's some expected additional "padding" time on both ends (no more than about an hour, typically).

The variability of the dispute window comes from the slight variance of block times. Arbitrum One's dispute window is 45818 blocks; this converts to ~1 week assuming 13.2 seconds per block, which was the average block time when Ethereum used Proof of Work (with the switch to Proof of Stake, average block times are about 12 seconds).

The "padding on both ends" involves three events that have to occur between a client receiving their transaction receipt from a Sequencer and their L2-to-L1 message being executable. After getting their receipt,

1. The Sequencer posts their transaction in a batch (usually within a few minutes, though the Sequencer will wait a bit longer if the L1 is congested). Then,
2. A validator includes their transaction in an RBlock (usually within the hour). Then, after the ~week long dispute window passes, the RBlock is confirmable, and
3. Somebody (anybody) confirms the RBlock on L1 (usually within ~15 minutes).

Additionally, in the rare and unlikely event of a dispute, this delay period will be extended for the dispute to resolve.

### What is a retryable ticket’s “submission fee”? How can I calculate it? What happens if the fee I provide is insufficient? {#q-submission-fee}

A [retryable’s](/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx) submission fee is a special fee a user must pay to create a retryable ticket. The fee is directly proportional to the size of the L1 calldata the retryable ticket uses. The fee can be queried using the `Inbox.calculateRetryableSubmissionFee` method. If insufficient fee is provided, the transactions will revert on L1, and the ticket won't get created.

### Which method in the Inbox contract should I use to submit a retryable ticket? {#q-retry-methods}

The method you should (almost certainly) use is `Inbox.createRetryableTicket`. There is an alternative method, `Inbox.unsafeCreateRetryableTicket`, which, as the name suggests, should only be used by those who fully understand its implications.

There are two differences between `createRetryableTicket` and `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket`:

1. `createRetryableTicket` will check that provided callvalue is sufficient to cover the costs of creating and executing the retryable ticket (at the specified parameters) and otherwise revert directly at L1. `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket`, in contrast, will allow a retryable ticket to be created that is guaranteed to revert on L2.

2. `createRetryableTicket` will check if either the provided `excessFeeRefundAddress` or the `callValueRefundAddress` are contracts on L1; if they are, to prevent the situation where refunds are _guaranteed_ to be irrecoverable on L2, it will convert them to their [address alias](/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx#address-aliasing), providing a _potential_ path for fund recovery. `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket` will allow the creation of a retryable ticket with refund addresses that are L1 contracts; since no L1 contract can alias to an address that is also itself an L1 contract, refunds to these addresses on L2 will be irrecoverable.

(Astute observers may note a third ticket creation method, `createRetryableTicketNoRefundAliasRewrite`; this is included only for backwards compatibility, but should be considered deprecated in favor of `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket`)
