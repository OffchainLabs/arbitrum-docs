### How do block.timestamp and block.number work on Arbitrum? {#q-blocknum}

Solidity calls to `block.number` and `block.timestamp` on Arbitrum will return the block number/ timestamp of the under lying L1 on a slight delay; i.e., updated every few minutes. Note that L2 block numbers (i.e., as seen in block explorers / returned by RPCs) are different, and are typically updated roughly every second.

For more info, see [block numbers and time](/time.mdx).
