# FAQs: Gas

### How does gas work on Arbitrum chains? {#q-gas}

Fees on Arbitrum chains are collected on L2 in the chains' native currency (ETH on both Arbitrum One and Nova).

A transaction fee is comprised of both an L1 and an L2 component:

The L1 component is meant to compensate the Sequencer for the cost of posting transactions on L1 (but no more). (See [L1 Pricing](/arbos/l1-pricing.mdx).)

The L2 component covers the cost of operating the L2 chain; it uses Geth for gas calculation and thus behaves nearly identically to L1 Ethereum (See [Gas](/arbos/gas.mdx)).

L2 Gas price adjusts responsively to chain congestion, ala EIP 1559.

### Why does it look like two identical transactions consume a different amount of gas? {#q-gas-changes}

Calling an Arbitrum node's `eth_estimateGas` RPC returns a value sufficient to cover both the L1 and L2 components of the fee for the current gas price; this is the value that, e.g., will appear in users' wallets in the "gas limit" field.

Thus, if the L1 calldata price changes over time, it will appear (in e.g., a wallet) that a transaction's gas limit is changing. In fact, the L2 gas limit isn't changing, merely the total gas required to cover the transaction's L1 + L2 fees.

### How is the L1 portion of an Arbitrum transaction’s gas fee computed? {#q-gas-l1}

The L1 fee that a transaction is required to pay is determined by compressing its data with brotli and multiplying the size of the result (in bytes) by ArbOS’s current call data price; the latter value can be queried via the `getPricesInWei` method of the `ArbGasInfo` precompile.

### Does Arbitrum have a mempool? {#q-mempool}

The Arbitrum Sequencer orders transactions on a first come, first served basis; the Sequencer inserts transactions into a queue based on the order they are received and executes them accordingly. This queue thus exists in lieu of a mempool. The Sequencer’s queue has no space limit; transactions on the queue will eventually timeout and be discarded if not executed in time.

### Do I need to pay a Priority fee for my Arbitrum transactions? {#q-priority}

Since transactions are processed in the order that the Sequencer receives them, no priority fee is necessary for Arbitrum transactions; if a transaction does include a priority fee, it will be refunded to the transaction’s origin address at the end of execution.
