title: "Quickstart: Launch an L3 chain"
description: "Launch your own L3 Arbitrum chain with the Arbitrum Nitro codebase's new license. Settle to Arbitrum's L2 chains via bridge contracts on the underlying L2 chain (One or Nova). No need for permission from the Arbitrum DAO or Offchain Labs to create your L3. Modify the Nitro codebase freely for your L3. Stay tuned for more information."
