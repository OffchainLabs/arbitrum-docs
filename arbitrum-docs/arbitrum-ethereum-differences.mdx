# Arbitrum/Ethereum Differences

Arbitrum is designed to be as compatible and consistent with Ethereum as possible, from its high-level RPCs to its low-level bytecode and everything in between. Dapp developers with experience building on Ethereum will likely find that little-to-no new L2-specific knowledge is required to build on Arbitrum.

This document presents an overview of some of the minor differences, perks, and gotchas that devs are advised to be aware of.

## Block and Transaction Properties

#### Blocks and Time

Time in L2 is tricky; the timing assumptions one is used to making about L1 blocks don't exactly carry over into the timing of Arbitrum blocks. For details, see [Block Numbers and Time](./time.mdx).

#### Block hashes and randomness

Arbitrum's L2 block hashes should not be relied on as a secure source of randomness (see ['blockhash(x);](./solidity-support.mdx))

#### L1 Fees

The L2 fees an Arbitrum transaction pays essentially work identically to gas fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum transactions must also, however, pay an L1-fee component to cover the cost of their calldata. (See [L1 pricing](./arbos/l1-pricing.mdx).)

## L1 to L2 Messages

Arbitrum chains support arbitrary L1 to L2 message passing; developers using this functionality should familiarize themselves with how they work (see [L1 to L2 Messaging](./arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx)). Of particular note:

- The result of a successful initial/"auto"-execution of an L1 to L2 message will be an unsigned L2 transaction receipt.
- The `msg.sender` of the L2 side of an L1 to L2 message will be not the initiating L1 address, but rather its address alias.
- Using the special `ethDeposit` method will _not_ result in an L2 contract's fallback function getting triggered.

Etc.

## Precompiles

Arbitrum chains include a number of special precompiles not present on Ethereum; see [Precompiles](/for-devs/concepts/precompiles.mdx).

## Solidity

You can deploy Solidity contracts onto Arbitrum just like you do Ethereum; there are only a few minor differences in behavior. See [Solidity Support](./solidity-support.mdx) for details.

## JSON-RPC Comparisons

This section covers the differences in response body fields you'll find when using the Arbitrum JSON-RPC vs Ethereum mainnet.

:::info

Comprehensive documentation on all generally available JSON-RPC methods for Ethereum [can be found at ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/). As Arbitrum has `go-ethereum` at its core, most of the documented methods there can be used with no modifications.

:::

### `eth_syncing` RPC Method

Calling `eth_syncing` returns false if not synchronizing (just like on Ethereum). However, if the node is still syncing, `eth_syncing` returns an object with data about the synchronization status. The returned object is different from what one would get on Ethereum, see [here](https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-can-i-verify-that-my-node-is-fully-synced) for more details.

### Blocks

When calling `eth_getBlockByHash` or `eth_getBlockByNumber`, Arbitrum includes a few additional fields and leverages some existing fields in different ways than mainnet Ethereum.

#### Additional Fields

- `l1BlockNumber`: An approximate L1 block number that occurred before this L2 block. See [Block Numbers and Time](time) for more info.
- `sendCount`: The number of L2-to-L1 messages since Nitro genesis
- `sendRoot`: The Merkle root of the Outbox tree state

#### Existing Fields With Different Behavior

- `extraData`: This field is equivalent to `sendRoot`
- `mixHash`: First 8 bytes is equivalent to `sendCount`, second 8 bytes is equivalent to `l1BlockNumber`
- `difficulty`: Fixed at `0x1`
- `gasLimit`: Value is fixed at `0x4000000000000`, but it's important to note that Arbitrum currently has a 32M gas limit per block

### Transactions

#### Transaction Types

In addition to the [three transaction types](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) currently supported on mainnet, Arbitrum adds additional types listed below and [documented in full detail here](arbos/geth#transaction-types).

On RPC calls that return transactions, such as [`eth_getTransactionByHash`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash), the `type` field will reflect the custom codes where applicable.

- `100` - `ArbitrumDepositTxType`: A deposit of ETH from L1 to L2 via the Arbitrum bridge.
- `101` - `ArbitrumUnsignedTxType`: An L1 user can use to call an L2 contract via the bridge.
- `102` - `ArbitrumContractTxType`: Allows an L1 contract to call an L2 contract method via the bridge.
- `104` - `ArbitrumRetryTxType`: Used to [redeem a retryable ticket](arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#redeeming-a-retryable) on L2, which finalizes a [retryable](/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#retryables) that failed to execute automatically (usually due to low gas).
- `105` - `ArbitrumSubmitRetryableTxType`: Retryable tickets are [submitted via the L1 bridge](/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#submitting-a-retryable) and allow arbitrary L1 to L2 messages to be created and executed on L2.
- `106` - `ArbitrumInternalTxType`: Internal transactions created by the ArbOS itself for certain state updates, like L1 base fee and block number.

#### Additional Fields

- `requestId`: Added to L1-to-L2 transactions to indicate position in the `Inbox` queue.

#### Existing Fields With Different Behavior

- `from`: For L1-to-L2 related transactions, will be the _aliased_ version of the L1's `msg.sender`. See [L1 to L2 Messaging](./arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx) for more info.

See full list of [mainnet transaction fields](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash) for additional reference.

### Tx Receipts

#### Additional Fields

- `l1BlockNumber`: The L1 block number that would be used [for block.number calls](time).
- `gasUsedForL1`: Amount of gas spent on L1 calldata in units of L2 gas.

See full list of [mainnet transaction receipt fields](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionreceipt) for additional reference.
