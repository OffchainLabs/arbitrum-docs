Arbitrum One supports two different types of USDC:

1.  **Arbitrum-native USDC (USDC)**: USDC tokens native to the Arbitrum One chain.
2.  **Bridged USDC (USDC.e)**: Ethereum-native USDC tokens that have been bridged to Arbitrum One.

### Differences between USDC and USDC.e

The Arbitrum Bridge will continue to facilitate transfers of all USDC tokens. When depositing Ethereum-native USDC, the option exists to receive Bridged USDC using Arbitrum's bridge or Arbitrum-native USDC using Circleâ€™s [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol).

### Historical context

Arbitrum One has supported Bridged USDC since conception, which previously had over a billion Bridged USDC in circulation. On June 8th 2023, Circle added support for the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol and launched Arbitrum-native USDC, which enabled direct minting and burning of Arbitrum-Native USDC on Arbitrum One. Due to this, the Bridged USDC token symbol was renamed from USDC to USDC.e to accommodate Arbitrum-native USDC. The expectation is that over time the conversion of Bridged USDC to Arbitrum-native USDC will continue.
