A semi-trusted promise from the [Sequencer](/intro/glossary#sequencer) to post a user's transaction in the near future; soft-confirmations happen prior to posting on the [Parent chain](/intro/glossary#parent-chain), and thus can be given near-instantaneously (i.e., faster than the parent chain's block times)
