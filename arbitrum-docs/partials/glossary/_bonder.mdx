A [Validator](/intro/glossary#validator) who deposits a bond (in Ether on [Arbitrum One](/intro/glossary#arbitrum-one) and [Arbitrum Nova](/intro/glossary#arbitrum-nova) ) to vouch for a particular [Assertion](/intro/glossary#assertion) in an Arbitrum Chain. A validator who bonds on a false assertion can expect to lose their bond. An honest bonder can recover their bond once the assertion they are bonded on has been confirmed.
