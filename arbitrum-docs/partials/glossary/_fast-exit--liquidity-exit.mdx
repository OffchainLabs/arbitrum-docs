A means by which a user can bypass an Arbitrum chain's [Challenge Period](/intro/glossary#challenge-period) when withdrawing fungible assets (or more generally, executing some "fungible" child chain to parent chain operation); for trustless fast exits, a liquidity provider facilitates an atomic swap of the asset on a child chain directly to a parent chain.
