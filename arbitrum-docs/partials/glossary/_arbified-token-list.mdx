A token list that conforms to [Uniswap's token list specification](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists); Arbified lists are generated by inputting externally maintained list ([i.e., coinmarketcap's list](https://api.coinmarketcap.com/data-api/v3/uniswap/all.json)) and outputting a list that includes all of the instances of token contracts on the Arbitrum chain bridged via the canonical [Arb Token Bridge](/intro/glossary#arb-token-bridge) from tokens on the inputted list. (See code [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-lists).)
