A [Validator](/intro/glossary#validator) who deposits a stake (in Ether on [Arbitrum One](/intro/glossary#arbitrum-one) and [Arbitrum Nova](/intro/glossary#arbitrum-nova) ) to vouch for a particular [Assertion](/intro/glossary#assertion) in an Arbitrum Chain. A validator who stakes on a false assertion can expect to lose their stake. An honest staker can recover their stake once the assertion they are staked on has been confirmed.
