A particular [Custom gateway](/intro/glossary#custom-gateway) via which an L1 token contract can be registered to a token contract deployed to L2. A useful alternative to the [StandardERC20 gateway](/intro/glossary#standarderc20-gateway) for projects that wish to control the address of their L2 token contract, maintain L2 token contract upgradability, and for various other use-cases.
