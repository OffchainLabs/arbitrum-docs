Off chain software that receives bids from [Timeboost](/intro/glossary#timeboost) participants, processes and validates bids, and then posts the top valid bid (or top two valid bids in the case of a tie) to the [Auction Contract](/intro/glossary#auction-contract) to resolve the on-going Timeboost auction. The autonomous auctioneer, for a given chain, is provisioned and deployed by an entity designated by the chain's owner.
