When two [Bonders](/intro/glossary#bonder) disagree about the correct verdict on an [Assertion](/intro/glossary#assertion), those bonders can be put in a challenge. The challenge is refereed by the contracts on the underlying chain. Eventually one bonder wins the challenge. The protocol guarantees that an honest party will always win a challenge; the loser forfeits their bond.
