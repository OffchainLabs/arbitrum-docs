When two [Staker](/intro/glossary#staker)s disagree about the correct verdict on an [Assertion](/intro/glossary#assertion), those stakers can be put in a challenge. The challenge is refereed by the contracts on the underlying chain. Eventually one staker wins the challenge. The protocol guarantees that an honest party will always win a challenge; the loser forfeits their stake.
