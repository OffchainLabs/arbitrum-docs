### Externally Owned Account {#externally-owned-account}
An externally owned account (EOA) is the account (public/private key pairs) that has a physical address location. Commonly referred to as a [wallet](/intro/glossary/#wallet), however, we distinguish an EOA from the user client software wallet.

A means by which a user can bypass an Arbitrum chain's [Challenge Period](/intro/glossary#challenge-period) when withdrawing fungible assets (or more generally, executing some "fungible" child chain to parent chain operation); for trustless fast exits, a liquidity provider facilitates an atomic swap of the asset on a child chain directly to a parent chain.

### Geth {#geth}

In the context of an Arbitrum chain, once transactions are posted in the chain's [Sequencer Inbox](/intro/glossary#sequencer-inbox), the only way the chain can experience a reorg is if its [Underlying Chain](/intro/glossary#underlying-chain) itself reorgs. Of note, [Fraud proofs](/intro/glossary#fraud-proof) do not cause reorgs.

### Retryable Autoredeem {#retryable-autoredeem}
The "automatic" (i.e., requiring no additional user action) execution of a [Retryable Ticket](/intro/glossary#retryable-ticket) on an Arbitrum chain.

### Retryable Redeem {#retryable-redeem}

### Soft Confirmation {#soft-confirmation}
A semi-trusted promise from the [Sequencer](/intro/glossary#sequencer) to post a user's transaction in the near future; soft-confirmations happen prior to posting on the [Parent chain](/intro/glossary#parent-chain), and thus can be given near-instantaneously (i.e., faster than the parent chain's block times)

### Standard Arb-Token {#standard-arbtoken}
An token contract on an Arbitrum chain deployed via the [`StandardERC20` gateway](/intro/glossary#standarderc20-gateway); offers basic `ERC-20` functionality in addition to deposit / withdrawal affordances.

### StandardERC20 gateway {#standarderc20-gateway}
[Token Gateway](/intro/glossary#token-gateway) via which any underlying chain's `ERC-20` token can permissionlessly bridge; the `StandardERC20` gateway contracts deploy a [Standard Arb-Token](/intro/glossary#standard-arbtoken) on the [Child chain](/intro/glossary#child-chain) for each bridged token.

### Token Gateway {#token-gateway}
A pair of contracts in the token bridge — one on the [Parent chain](/intro/glossary#parent-chain) , one on the [Child chain](/intro/glossary#child-chain) — that provide a particular mechanism for handling the transfer of tokens between layers. Token gateways currently active in the bridge include the [`StandardERC20` gateway](/intro/glossary#standarderc20-gateway) , the [Generic-Custom Gateway](/intro/glossary#genericcustom-gateway) , and the [WETH Gateway](/intro/glossary#weth-gateway).

### Transaction Ordering Policy {#transaction-ordering-policy}
The rules and logic employed by a chain to order incoming transactions into a block.

### Trustless {#trustless}
In the context of Ethereum, trustless refers to the ability of a system to operate without reliance on a central authority or intermediary. Instead, users place their trust in math and protocols.

This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus mechanisms that let users verify the integrity of network transactions using open-source software. Trustless systems are considered to be more secure and resistant to fraud or tampering because they don't rely on a single point of failure that can be exploited by attackers.

A popular WebAssembly runtime for executing [WASM](/intro/glossary#wasm) binaries. [A fork of WASMer](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/wasmer) is used for executing [Stylus](/intro/glossary#stylus) programs. WASMer executes considerably faster than Geth executes EVM code, contributing to Stylus's lower fees.

### Watchtower Validator {#watchtower-validator}
A [Validator](/intro/glossary#validator) that never bonds / never takes on chain action, who raises the alarm (by whatever offchain means it chooses) if it witnesses an invalid assertion.

### WETH Gateway {#weth-gateway}
[Token Gateway](/intro/glossary#token-gateway) for handing the bridging of wrapped Ether (`WETH`). `WETH` is unwrapped on the parent chain and rewrapped on the parent chain upon depositing (and vice-versa upon withdrawing), ensuring `WETH` on the child chain always remains collateralized.
