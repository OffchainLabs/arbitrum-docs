This is a short guide on how response times work and how express lane transactions are sequenced, alongside common errors and best practices for using Timeboost. This guide assumes you have already reviewed our guide on [How to use Timeboost](../run-arbitrum-node/how-to-use-timeboost.mdx).

## How response times work

The response for a transaction submission is returned only once the block containing the transaction is produced. For example, irrespective of the type of transaction (express lane or normal), if a transaction arrives at the sequencer at `t=0ms` and the block is produced at `t=250ms`, then the expected response time is always (`time_to_arrive`) + 250ms, where `time_to_arrive` is the time it took for the transaction to be received by the sequencer.

As another example, assume that a transaction is submitted at `t=150ms`. If the transaction is an express lane transaction, then the response would be returned at `t =(time_to_arrive)+ 100ms`. If, however, the submitted transaction is a normal transaction, then the transaction’s inclusion will be delayed by 200ms, resulting in a response time at `t=(time_to_arrive)+100ms+250ms` (250ms because this is the time it takes to create the next block).

## How express lane transactions are ordered into blocks

The express lane time advantage is currently set to 200ms while the current block creation time is 250ms. This means that if an express lane transaction and a normal transaction both arrive at the sequencer at the same time, but _before 50ms have passed since the last block was produced_, then both the transactions may appear in the same block, though the express lane transaction would be sequenced ahead of the normal transaction.

Express lane transactions are processed in the order of their `sequenceNumber`, which is a field in every express lane transaction. The first expected sequence number for a new round is zero and increments for each accepted transaction. You can read more about how to submit express lane transactions in: [How to submit transactions to the express lane](../run-arbitrum-node/how-to-use-timeboost.mdx#how-to-submit-transactions-to-the-express-lane).

## Errors relating to the sequenceNumber

The `sequenceNumber` field when submitting an express lane transaction is important because transactions with `sequenceNumber=n` can only be sequenced after all the transactions from `sequenceNumber=0` to `sequenceNumber=n-1` have been sequenced.

When it comes to submitting express lane transactions, there are different types of error responses that may arise relating to the `sequenceNumber`. Below is a breakdown of the various error messages related to sequence numbers and the recommendation on how to avoid them. Error messages are subject to change.

To illustrate how sequence numbers are used to accept or reject express lane transactions, assume first that the sequence number for a given round is `n` (i.e `0` to `n-1` sequence numbers were accepted in this round) and there is some maximum allowed sequence number limit `m` that the sequencer can keep track of (for DoS protections).

If the sequence number for your express lane transaction is:

- Less than `n`, then your transaction will be rejected because it has already accepted a transaction with that sequence number (`error="SEQUENCE_NUMBER_TOO_LOW"`).
- Exactly `n`, then your transaction will be accepted as soon as it is received by the sequencer.
- Greater than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then your transaction will be buffered to be processed. Your transaction will only be accepted once transactions with the other sequence numbers arrive to fill in the “gap” between the sequencer number `n` and your transaction’s sequence number. You may receive a timeout error if the transactions within the gap arrive after the timeout (i.e. between n and your transaction’s sequence number), but this doesn’t mean your transaction was rejected - it may eventually get processed and so we recommend checking the transaction receipts ([error #1 below](../run-arbitrum-node/troubleshoot-timeboost.mdx#error-1)).
- Greater than `m`, then your transaction will be rejected ([error #2 below](../run-arbitrum-node/troubleshoot-timeboost.mdx#error-2)).

Timeboost's implementation of the above described sequence number reordering buffer is intended to handle out-of-order delivery of transactions in the case of network delays (enroute to the sequencer). This implementation is subject to change as we gather feedback from users.

#### Error 1: Timeout error

`"Accepted timeboost tx failed: Sequence number: %d (consumed), Transaction hash: %v, Error: Transaction sequencing hit timeout, result for the submitted transaction is not yet available: %w"`

This means the transaction was received with a sequence number after the expected sequence number, and the transactions with prior sequence numbers were not received in time.

Using an example to illustrate this case: this error could arise in the case where the sequencer has sequenced an express lane transaction with `sequenceNumber=3` already but the express lane transaction that was submitted used `sequenceNumber=5`. Since `sequenceNumber=4` has not yet been sequenced, then the sequencer will respond by saying the result for the submitted transaction (with `sequenceNumber=5`) is “not yet available”.

The transaction may still have been processed, despite this error message, if transactions with the missing prior sequence numbers are received. Check for the transaction receipt.

#### Error 2: Sequence number reaching the max allowed limit

`"message sequence number has reached max allowed limit. SequenceNumber: %d, Limit: %d",`
This means the `sequenceNumber` of the received transaction is ahead of the next expected sequence number by more than the limit. To resolve, we simply re-submit your transactions in sequential `sequenceNumber` order.

#### Error 3: Already-consumed `sequenceNumber` related errors

`"Accepted timeboost tx failed: Sequence number: %d (consumed), Transaction hash: %v, Error: $some error unrelated to timeout$”`  
This type of error means that the underlying transaction of the express lane submission has errored for another reason and the corresponding `sequenceNumber` has been consumed. A description of these other types of errors can be found [here](../run-arbitrum-node/how-to-use-timeboost.mdx#how-to-submit-transactions-to-the-express-lane).

#### Other Errors

Other errors should be self-explanatory - more details can be found on our page about [How to submit transactions to the express lane](../run-arbitrum-node/how-to-use-timeboost.mdx#how-to-submit-transactions-to-the-express-lane).
