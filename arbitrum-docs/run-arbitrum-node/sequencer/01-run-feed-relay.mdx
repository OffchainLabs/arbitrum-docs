:::caution

If running a single node, there is no need to run a feed relay. When running more that one node, it is strongly suggested to run a single feed relay per datacenter, which will reduce ingress fees and improve stability.

:::

:::caution

Feed endpoints will soon require compression with a custom dictionary, so if connecting to feed with anything other than a standard node, it is strongly suggested to run a local feed relay which will provide an uncompressed feed by default.

:::

The feed relay is in the same docker image as the Nitro node.

- Here is an example of how to run the feed relay for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.5.3-0a9c975@@ --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed --chain.id=42161
  ```
- Here is an example of how to run nitro-node for Arbitrum One with custom relay:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.5.3-0a9c975@@ --parent-chain.connection.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --chain.id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642
  ```

Note that Arbitrum classic does not communicate with Nitro sequencer, so classic relay is no longer used.

## Helm charts (Kubernetes)

If you are using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to run your feed relay, a helm chart is available at [ArtifactHUB](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/offchainlabshelm/relay). It supports running a Nitro relay by providing the feed input URL. Find more information in the [OCL community Helm charts repository](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/community-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/relay).
