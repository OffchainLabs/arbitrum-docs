# Orbit Chain Concepts

Understand the fundamental concepts behind Arbitrum Orbit chains and how they work.

## What are Orbit Chains?

Arbitrum Orbit chains are custom, permissioned chains that you can deploy and configure for your specific use case. They provide:

- **Customizable Parameters** - Configure gas tokens, governance, and economic policies
- **Dedicated Throughput** - Your own blockchain capacity without sharing
- **Full Control** - Manage upgrades, features, and access controls
- **Arbitrum Security** - Inherit security from the underlying Arbitrum chain

## Chain Architecture

Orbit chains can be deployed as:

- **L3 on Arbitrum** - Deploy on top of Arbitrum One or Nova
- **L2 Orbit Chains** - Deploy directly on Ethereum mainnet
- **Rollup vs AnyTrust** - Choose your data availability model

## Public Preview Status

Learn about the current public preview status of Orbit chains and what to expect during this phase.

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability** - Handle application-specific transaction volumes
- **Customization** - Tailor the chain to your application's needs  
- **Cost Efficiency** - Predictable and controlled operating costs
- **Developer Experience** - Full EVM compatibility with enhanced features

Understanding these concepts will help you make informed decisions about deploying and configuring your Orbit chain.
