Trustless scaling solutions built on top of Ethereum's [Layer 1 (L1)](/intro/glossary#layer-1-l1) base protocol, such as state channels, plasma chains, optimistic rollups, and ZK-rollups. Layer 2 solutions aim to increase scalability and reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum's Layer 1 without introducing additional trust assumptions.
