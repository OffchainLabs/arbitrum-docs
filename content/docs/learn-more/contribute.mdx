Thank you for considering to contribute to the Arbitrum documentation! We're excited to have you on board.

The [`docs.arbitrum.io`](https://docs.arbitrum.io/) docs portal is the **single source of truth** for documentation that supports Offchain Labs' product portfolio. Contributions are welcome from the entire Ethereum community.

This document shows you how to craft and publish Arbitrum documentation. Familiarity with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax, Github, and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) is expected.
