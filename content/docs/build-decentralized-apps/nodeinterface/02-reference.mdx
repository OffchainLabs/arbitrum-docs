title: 'NodeInterface reference'
description: A reference page of the NodeInterface available on Arbitrum chains
---

The Arbitrum Nitro software includes a special `NodeInterface` contract available at address `0xc8` that is only accessible via RPCs (it's not actually deployed onchain, and thus can't be called by smart contracts). This reference page documents the specific calls available in the `NodeInterface`. For a more conceptual description of what it is and how it works, please refer to the [`NodeInterface` conceptual page](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/nodeinterface/01-overview).
