The Arbitrum protocol and related tooling makes it easy for developers to build cross-chain applications; i.e., applications that involve sending messages from Ethereum to an Arbitrum chain, and/or from an Arbitrum chain to Ethereum.

## Ethereum-to-Arbitrum messaging

Arbitrary parent to child chain contract calls can be created via the Inbox's `createRetryableTicket` method; upon publishing the parent chain transaction, the child chain side will typically get included within minutes. Commonly, the child chain execution will automatically succeed, but if reverts, and it can be rexecuted via a call to the `redeem` method of the [`ArbRetryableTx`](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference#arbretryabletx) precompile.

For details and protocol specification, see [Parent to child chain messages](/how-arbitrum-works/10-l1-to-l2-messaging).

For an example of retryable tickets in action, see the [`Greeter`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter) tutorial, which uses the [Arbitrum SDK](../../sdk).

## Arbitrum-to-Ethereum messaging

Similarly, child chain contracts can send Arbitrary messages for execution on the parent chain. These are initiated via calls to the [`ArbSys`](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference#arbsys) precompile contract's `sendTxToL1` method. Upon confirmation (about one week later), they can execute by retrieving the relevant data via a call to `NodeInterface` contract's `constructOutboxProof` method, and then executing them via the `Outbox`'s `executeTransaction` method.

For details and protocol specification, see [Child to parent chain messages](/how-arbitrum-works/11-l2-to-l1-messaging).

For a demo, see the [Outbox Tutorial](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/outbox-execute).
