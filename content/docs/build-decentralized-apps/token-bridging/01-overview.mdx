description: An overview of token bridging resources
---

Token bridging is a fundamental aspect of any Layer 2 (child chain) protocol. Arbitrum uses its ability to pass messages between parent and child chains (see [Cross-chain messaging](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/04-cross-chain-messaging)) to allow projects to trustlessly move assets from Ethereum to an Arbitrum chain and back. Any asset and asset type can in principle be bridged, including Ether, `ERC-20` tokens and `ERC-721` tokens among others.

This section offers a series of conceptual documents explaining how asset bridging works and what options exist to bridge ether (`ETH`) and other types of asset between layers, as well as a series of how-tos showcasing the different methods available for making your token bridgeable.

This section is divided in three parts:

- [`ETH` bridging](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/02-token-bridge-ether): explains how Arbitrum handles bridging `ETH`, the native token of Ethereum and the Arbitrum chains, between the parent and child chain.
- [`ERC-20` token bridging](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/03-token-bridge-erc20): explains the architecture of the token bridge for this type of asset, describing the different options available to make a token bridgeable.
- [Bridge tokens programmatically](/docs/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/bridge-tokens-programmatically/01-get-started): goes over the process of making an `ERC-20` token bridgeable using the different types of gateways available in the token bridge.
