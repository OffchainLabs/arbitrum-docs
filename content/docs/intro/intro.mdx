## Hello! What's Arbitrum?

Hi! Arbitrum is a technology suite designed to scale Ethereum. You can use Arbitrum chains to do all things you do on Ethereum — use Web3 apps, deploy smart contracts, etc., but your transactions will be cheaper and faster. Our flagship product — Arbitrum Rollup — is an Optimistic rollup protocol that inherits Ethereum-level security.

## What, what's "Ethereum"? What's a "smart contract"? Where am I?

If you aren't yet familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem, you can check out [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) for an intro. Come back whenever you're ready, no rush.

## You said Arbitrum exists to "scale" Ethereum; why does Ethereum need this help?

Ethereum is awesome; on its own, however, it's also very limited. The Ethereum blockchain only allows about 20-40 transactions per second (TPS) (that's in total, for all Ethereum users); when the limit is reached, users are forced to compete against each other for their transactions to be included, which causes fees to go up.
