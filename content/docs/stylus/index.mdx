# Stylus

Stylus enables developers to write high-performance smart contracts in programming languages like Rust and C++, while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## What is Stylus?

Stylus is Arbitrum's next-generation programming environment that:

- **Supports Multiple Languages** - Write contracts in Rust, C++, and other WASM-compatible languages
- **EVM Compatibility** - Interoperate seamlessly with existing Solidity contracts
- **Performance Optimized** - Up to 10x faster execution and significantly lower gas costs
- **Memory Safe** - Leverage the safety guarantees of modern programming languages
