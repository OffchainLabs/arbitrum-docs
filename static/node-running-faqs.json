    "question": "How can I check if the node is running properly and diagnose the issue if it is not?",
    "answer": "<p>\nWe have trace-level logging RPC request implemented on our node. You could use it to log all requests and responses at the trace level. (The performance impact of this should be negligible compared to the network overhead of an RPC request in the first place, especially considering that the request/response will only be serialized for logging if that log level is enabled.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

    "question": "Why do I need an L1 node to run an Arbitrum node?",
    "answer": "<p>\nOn the node syncing stage, Arbitrum nodes read transactions from batches that were previously posted on L1 and have been executed. They then connect to the Sequencer feed to receive new incoming batched transactions that have not yet been posted on L1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen fully synced, the Arbitrum node uses the State Transition Function (STF) to consume transactions coming from the Sequencer feed and creates a new state. It also waits for the L1 batch to be posted. If the L1 batch that is finalized on L1 is different from what the Sequencer published, the node will change the state based on the L1 batched transactions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

  {
    "question": "Can I run an Arbitrum node in p2p mode?",
    "answer": "<p>\nArbitrum doesn't have a consensus mechanism, so \"p2p mode\" doesn't apply. For nodes to sync to the latest chain state, they connect to an L1 node to sync the chain's history that's been posted in calldata and connect to the Sequencer feed for the transactions that have yet to be posted in batches. In no case do nodes need to peer up and sync with each other.\n</p>\n\n",

    "question": "Is there any way to retrieve pre-Nitro archive data from a Nitro node?",
    "answer": "<p>\nThe pre-nitro stack is also referred to as the \"classic\" stack. Full nitro nodes start with a database that contains the information from the \"classic\" era. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, it is not possible for a nitro node to query archive information contained in \"classic\" blocks right away. To do that, you need to also run a classic node (<a href=\"https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-classic-node\">instructions here</a>) and set the parameter <code>—node.rpc.classic-redirect=your-classic-node-RPC</code>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKeep in mind that this information only applies to Arbitrum One nodes. Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum Sepolia nodes started with a Nitro stack from the beginning, so they don't have \"classic\" data.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

Nitro execution and bottleneck are different from a normal Geth node, so <code>eth_syncing</code> output is unique to nitro.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can find information to understand the output of <code>eth_syncing</code> in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/differences-between-arbitrum-ethereum/rpc-methods#eth_syncing\">RPC methods</a> page.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",
