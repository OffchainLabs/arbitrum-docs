{"question": "How does gas work on Arbitrum?","answer": "Fees on Arbitrum chains are collected on L2 in the chains' native currency (ETH on both Arbitrum One and Nova).\n\nA transaction fee is comprised of both an L1 and an L2 component:\n\nThe L1 component is meant to compensate the Sequencer for the cost of posting transactions on L1 (but no more). (See [L1 Pricing](https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing).)\n\nThe L2 component covers the cost of operating the L2 chain; it uses Geth for gas calculation and thus behaves nearly identically to L1 Ethereum. One difference is that unlike on Ethereum, Arbitrum chains enforce a gas price floor; currently 0.1 gwei on Arbitrum One and 0.01 gwei on Nova (See [Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas)).\n\nL2 Gas price adjusts responsively to chain congestion, ala EIP 1559.\n\n\n\n","key": "how-does-gas-work-on-arbitrum"},
{"question": "I tried to create a retryable ticket but the transaction reverted on L1.  How can I debug the issue?","answer": "Creation of retryable tickets can revert with one of these custom errors:\n\n1. **`InsufficientValue`**: not enough gas included in your L1 transaction's callvalue to cover the total cost of your retryable ticket; i.e., `msg.value &lt; (maxSubmissionCost + l2CallValue + gasLimit * maxFeePerGas)`. Note that your L1 transaction's callvalue must cover this full cost. See [Retryable Tickets Lifecycle](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#submission) for more information.\n2. **`InsufficientSubmissionCost`****:** The provided submission cost isn't high enough to create your retryable ticket.\n3. **`GasLimitTooLarge`****:** provided gas limit is greater than 2^64\n4. **`DataTooLarge`**: provided data is greater than 117.964 KB (90% of Geth's 128 KB transaction size limit).\nTo figure out which error caused your transaction to revert, we recommend using Etherscan's Parity VM trace support (Tenderly is generally a useful debugging tool; however, it can be buggy when it comes to custom Geth errors).\n\nUse the following link to view the Parity VM trace of your failed transaction (replacing the tx-hash with your own, and using the appropriate etherscan root url):\n\n[https://etherscan.io/vmtrace?txhash=0x51a8088c9b319bbad649c36d9cf2b4e9b61a6099a158181676c8e79dbce2df58&type=parity#raw](https://etherscan.io/vmtrace?txhash=0x51a8088c9b319bbad649c36d9cf2b4e9b61a6099a158181676c8e79dbce2df58&type=parity#raw)\n\nTo find out the reversion error signature, go to the **Raw Traces** tab, and scroll down to find the last **Subtrace** where your transaction was reverted. Then find **Output** field of that subtrace.\n\n(In the above example, the desirable **Output** is: `0xfadf238a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c4df7e2903b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a39a1d002808`)\n\nThe first four bytes of the output are the custom error signature; in our example, it is `0xfadf238a`.\n\nTo let's find out which custom error this signature represents, we can use this handy tool by Samzcsun:  [https://sig.eth.samczsun.com/](https://sig.eth.samczsun.com/)\n\nChecking 0xfadf238a gives us `InsufficientSubmissionCost(uint256,uint256)`.\n\n","key": "i-tried-to-create-a-retryable-ticket-but-the-transaction-reverted-on-l1--how-can-i-debug-the-issue"},

{"question": "How many block numbers must we wait for in Arbitrum before we can confidently state that the transaction has reached finality?","answer": "Arbitrum's block intervals fluctuate with throughput, so relying on block numbers for finality isn't recommended. However, Arbitrum nodes support Ethereum's JSON RPC, enabling the use of `[eth_getBlockByNumber()](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber)` to determine block finality. Here, we provide additional details on how to achieve this.\n\n\n\nYou can use `[eth_getBlockByNumber()](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber)` with the string `\"latest\"`, `\"safe\"`, or `\"finalized\"`, each offering varying degrees of finality:\n\n\n\n-  `latest`: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number, also known as the tip of the chain. This block is typically the last sequenced block and may not yet be posted on L1. As long as you trust the Sequencer to eventually post this information on L1, relying on the `latest` block should be fine. \n-  `safe`: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number that has achieved attestations from a two-thirds majority of Ethereum's validator set. This occurs when the Sequencer's batch is posted as an L1 block on Ethereum and then the batch transactions achieve `safe` finality there. While safe blocks are typically resistant to re-orgs, they can still be re-orged in the event of a significant L1 re-org.\n-  `finalized`: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number that is finalized on Ethereum. This means that the Sequencer's batch has been published** **as an L1 block on the Ethereum network and has reached a substantial depth, making it eligible for hard finality. Unlike `safe` blocks, `finalized` blocks are highly improbable to undergo re-orgs. \n\n\nTo learn more about the different phases of an Arbitrum transaction, from client initiation to Layer 1 confirmation, check out [The Lifecycle of an Arbitrum Transaction](https://docs.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle).\n\n\n\n","key": "how-many-block-numbers-must-we-wait-for-in-arbitrum-before-we-can-confidently-state-that-the-transaction-has-reached-finality"},

{"question": "Why is the fee of some Classic transactions slightly different than the multiplication of gasLimit and effectiveGasPrice?","answer": "Gas prices in Classic transactions worked differently from those in Nitro transactions. Classic transactions handled four different prices: L1 fixed, L1 calldata, L2 computation, and L2 storage. You can view all these prices in the **Advanced TxInfo** tab on Arbiscan (see an [example](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xecfe992adc408d1458d97b6e066ea7f4169bf048e84cb7a4beaea6e9c54f07da#txninfo) here).\n\nWhen querying the receipt of a Classic transaction on a Nitro node, some calculation is needed to obtain an `effectiveGasPrice` that is close to (but not exactly) what those four prices represent. That's why if you multiply the `gasLimit` by the `effectiveGasPrice` you might end up with a transaction fee that is slightly different than the actual fee paid.\n\nTo get the exact fees paid, you can query a Classic node, which will return all the accurate information in an object called `feeStats`.

{"question": "How can I interpret Arbitrum transaction traces?","answer": "In Arbitrum, every block contains a system transaction of type `[ArbitrumInternalTxType](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/geth#ArbitrumInternalTx)`, which the ArbOS itself creates for specific state updates, such as the L1 base fee and the block number. These transactions are distinct from typical Ethereum transactions. They are exclusively generated by the ArbOS state transition function, rather than by external entities such as externally owned accounts (EOAs) or smart contracts. Despite having an `INVALID` opcode, these transactions are represented in the trace API to signify their presence in the block, even though an opcode within EVM execution does not trigger them.\n\nOne of the key functionalities of `ArbitrumInternalTxType` involves managing value transfers related to acknowledging batch postings. When batches of transactions get submitted to Layer 1, a special cross-chain message is produced as a receipt, confirming the successful posting of the batch. The function `ApplyInternalTxUpdate` is responsible for processing and updating the system's state based on these crosschain messages, ensuring consistency and integrity across the Arbitrum network.\n\nAnother functionality of `ArbitrumInternalTxType` transactions is handling the value held in retryables if discarded. Retryable transactions are transactions that can be \"resubmitted\" if they fail to execute on the destination chain. However, in certain scenarios, these retryable transactions might get discarded, for instance, due to expiration or other conditions.\n\nIn such cases, the escrowed call value, which is the value associated with the retryable transaction, will be paid out to a specified `callValueRefundAddress` account. This address designation occurs during the initial submission of the transaction on the parent chain. The purpose of this mechanism is to ensure that funds associated with retryable transactions are not lost if they cannot be successfully executed, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the Arbitrum network.\n\nTo accurately reflect the value transfers associated with these transactions, we employ a unique `callType` parameter: `invalid`. Unlike conventional EVM calls (such as `delegatecall`, `call`, etc.), this designation signifies a different system transaction. It denotes a straightforward value transfer from one account to another, with no inherent invocation of smart contract logic. While technically feasible to conduct this transfer within a conventional call type, our deliberate choice of **invalid** aims to enhance the clarity and distinctiveness of this transaction type within the EVM ecosystem.\n\nNotably, the sender account remains consistent across all instances of this transaction type for the batch posting receipt version. However, it's important to note that for retryable transactions, the sender account differs as each retryable transaction escrows its value in a unique vault specific to that transaction. This unique vault ensures that funds associated with each retryable transaction are stored securely until either the transaction successfully executes or a refund is issued.\n\n**Note that:**\n\n- All pre-Nitro transactions are labeled as `ArbitrumLegacyTxType` by Nitro.\n- Traces are not available for pre-Nitro (Classic) transactions.\n","key": "how-can-i-interpret-arbitrum-transaction-traces"},
{"question": "Why do some blocks have a total gas limit that's over the standard block gas limit?","answer": "The execution gas block limit of Arbitrum chains is 32 million. However, when querying a block, we may find a gasLimit value that exceeds the specified number.\n\nFinding it exceeds happens because this `gasLimit` field accounts for both execution gas and the corresponding gas limit of the L1 costs (you can find more information about the role of the L1 costs in a transaction's gas limit in [this article](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9)). The gas limit corresponding to L1 costs is practically unlimited, leading to the possibility of finding very high values on the gasLimit field of a block.\n\nThe effective block gas limit (32 million) only accounts for execution gas limit. We can check the actual gas used for execution on a specific block by checking the gasUsed field.\n\n","key": "why-do-some-blocks-have-a-total-gas-limit-thats-over-the-standard-block-gas-limit"}
