    "question": "How does gas work on Arbitrum?",
    "answer": "<p>\nFees on Arbitrum chains are collected on L2 in the chains' native currency (ETH on both Arbitrum One and Nova).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA transaction fee is comprised of both an L1 and an L2 component:\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe L1 component is meant to compensate the Sequencer for the cost of posting transactions on L1 (but no more). (See <a href=\"https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing\">L1 Pricing</a>.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe L2 component covers the cost of operating the L2 chain; it uses Geth for gas calculation and thus behaves nearly identically to L1 Ethereum. One difference is that unlike on Ethereum, Arbitrum chains enforce a gas price floor; currently 0.1 gwei on Arbitrum One and 0.01 gwei on Nova (See <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas\">Gas</a>).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nL2 Gas price adjusts responsively to chain congestion, ala EIP 1559.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

    "question": "How many block numbers must we wait for in Arbitrum before we can confidently state that the transaction has reached finality?",
    "answer": "<p>\nArbitrum's block intervals fluctuate with throughput, so relying on block numbers for finality isn't recommended. However, Arbitrum nodes support Ethereum's JSON RPC, enabling the use of <code><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber\">eth_getBlockByNumber()</a></code> to determine block finality. Here, we provide additional details on how to achieve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can use <code><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber\">eth_getBlockByNumber()</a></code> with the string <code>\"latest\"</code>, <code>\"safe\"</code>, or <code>\"finalized\"</code>, each offering varying degrees of finality:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <code>latest</code>: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number, also known as the tip of the chain. This block is typically the last sequenced block and may not yet be posted on L1. As long as you trust the Sequencer to eventually post this information on L1, relying on the <code>latest</code> block should be fine. </li>\n<li> <code>safe</code>: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number that has achieved attestations from a two-thirds majority of Ethereum's validator set. This occurs when the Sequencer's batch is posted as an L1 block on Ethereum and then the batch transactions achieve <code>safe</code> finality there. While safe blocks are typically resistant to re-orgs, they can still be re-orged in the event of a significant L1 re-org.</li>\n<li> <code>finalized</code>: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number that is finalized on Ethereum. This means that the Sequencer's batch has been published<strong> </strong>as an L1 block on the Ethereum network and has reached a substantial depth, making it eligible for hard finality.

    "answer": "<p>\nThe error <code>intrinsic gas too low</code> usually refers to not providing enough gas to pay for the L1 component of the transaction fees. This is usually a problem related to not setting a high enough gas limit (instead of gas price), due to how Arbitrum handles gas. You can find more information in the article <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9\">Understanding Arbitrum: 2-dimensional fees</a> and the page <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas\">How to estimate gas</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

    "question": "How can I interpret Arbitrum transaction traces?",
    "answer": "<p>\nIn Arbitrum, every block contains a system transaction of type <code><a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/geth#ArbitrumInternalTx\">ArbitrumInternalTxType</a></code>, which is created by the ArbOS itself for specific state updates, such as the L1 base fee and the block number. These transactions are distinct from typical Ethereum transactions and are exclusively generated by the ArbOS state transition function, not by external entities like externally owned accounts (EOAs) or smart contracts. Despite having an <code>INVALID</code> opcode, these transactions are represented in the trace API to signify their presence in the block, even though they're not triggered by an opcode within EVM execution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of the key functionalities of <code>ArbitrumInternalTxType</code> involves managing value transfers related to acknowledging batch postings. When batches of transactions are submitted to Layer 1, a special cross-chain message is produced as a receipt, confirming the successful posting of the batch. The function <code>ApplyInternalTxUpdate</code> is responsible for processing and updating the system's state based on these cross-chain messages, ensuring consistency and integrity across the Arbitrum network.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnother functionality of <code>ArbitrumInternalTxType</code> transactions is handling the value held in retryables when they are discarded. Retryable transactions are essentially transactions that can be retried if they fail to execute on the destination chain. However, in certain scenarios, these retryable transactions might get discarded, for instance, due to expiration or other conditions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn such cases, the escrowed call value, which is the value associated with the retryable transaction, will be paid out to a specified <code>callValueRefundAddress</code> account. This address is designated during the initial submission of the transaction on the parent chain. The purpose of this mechanism is to ensure that funds associated with retryable transactions are not lost in case they cannot be successfully executed, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the Arbitrum network.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo accurately reflect value transfers associated with these transactions, we employ a unique <code>callType</code> parameter: <code>invalid</code>. Unlike conventional EVM calls (such as <code>delegatecall</code>, <code>call</code>, etc.), this designation signifies a different system transaction. Essentially, it denotes a straightforward value transfer from one account to another, with no inherent invocation of smart contract logic. While technically feasible to conduct this transfer within a conventional call type, our deliberate choice of <code>invalid</code> aims to enhance the clarity and distinctiveness of this transaction type within the EVM ecosystem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNotably, the sender account remains consistent across all instances of this transaction type for the batch posting receipt version. However, it's important to note that for retryable transactions, the sender account differs as each retryable transaction escrows its value in a unique vault specific to that transaction. This ensures that funds associated with each retryable transaction are securely held until either successful execution or eventual refund.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<br />\n<strong>Note that:</strong>\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All pre-Nitro transactions are labeled as <code>ArbitrumLegacyTxType</code> by Nitro.</li>\n<li>Traces are not available for pre-Nitro (Classic) transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",

    "question": "Why do some blocks have a total gas limit that's over the standard block gas limit?",
    "answer": "<p>\nThe execution gas block limit of Arbitrum chains is 32 million. However, when querying a block, we might find a <code>gasLimit</code> value that exceeds that number.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis happens because this gasLimit field accounts for both execution gas and the correspondent gas limit of the L1 costs (you can find more information about the role of the L1 costs in a transaction's gas limit on <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9\">this article</a>). The gas limit corresponding to L1 costs is practically unlimited, so we might find very high values on the gasLimit field of a block. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe effective block gas limit (32 million) only accounts for execution gas limit. We can check the actual gas used for execution on a specific block, by checking the <code>gasUsed</code> field.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n",
