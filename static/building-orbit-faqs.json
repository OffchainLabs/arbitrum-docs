{"question": "What fee collectors can be configured on my chain?","answer": "Four fee types are configurable on an Orbit chain:\n\n- **L2 base fee**: L2 execution fees corresponding to the minimum base price of the chain. This fee is deposited into the infraFeeAccount, which can be set by calling `ArbOwner.setInfraFeeAccount().`\n- **L2 surplus fee**: L2 execution fees above the minimum base price (in the case of congestion). This fee goes to the `networkFeeAccount`, which can be set by calling `ArbOwner.setNetworkFeeAccount().`\n- **L1 base fee**: Relative fees for posting a transaction on the parent chain. This fee is paid ultimately to the fee collector of the active batch poster. A call to `SequencerInbox.setIsBatchPoster()` on the parent chain will set the batch poster. Delegating a different fee collector for that batch poster can be specified by calling `ArbAggregator.setFeeCollector()`.\n- **L1 surplus fee**: Any extra fees rewarded to the batch poster. This is paid to a specific `L1RewardRecipient`, which can be set by calling `ArbOwner.setL1PricingRewardRecipient()`.\nFor more detailed information about fees, please refer to the [L1 Fees](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing) and [L2 Fees](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas) pages.\n\nTo learn more about precompiles, refer to the [Precompiles reference page](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/reference).\n\n","key": "what-fee-collectors-can-be-configured-on-my-chain"},
{"question": "What is the lowest you can set the base fee to?","answer": "You can set the base fee to any amount to charge users less.

{"question": "Can you set the block speed below 100ms?","answer": "The implications of reducing the block speed below 100ms are that an increased block count will put more strain on third-party providers, node runners, indexers, etc.\n\n","key": "can-you-set-the-block-speed-below-100ms"},
{"question": "Can I set fast deposits for an L3?","answer": "Yes, we have documented fast deposits in [how to configure delayed inbox finality](https://www.notion.so/launch-arbitrum-chain/how-tos/arbitrum-chain-finality.mdx).\n\n\n\nThere is a flag that can be changed, which allows an Arbitrum chain to wait for finality on the parent chain before depositing a transaction.\n\n\nFor an L3 on Arb One, for example, we consider this a feature because they can instantly register a deposit on the child chain, as Arb One has an ultra-low re-org risk (having never re-organized).\n\n\nFor an L2, however, we recommend waiting ~12 minutes for L1 finality, as there is a greater risk of reorganization, for example, the deposit transaction not being included immediately in the fork-choice.\n\n","key": "can-i-set-fast-deposits-for-an-l3"},

Be sure to modify everything starting with the latest version, which includes a couple of extra safety checks that may help prevent issues.\n2. You could disable this limit if you were confident you would stick to AnyTrust and not need to fall back to posting data onchain.\n3.

{"question": "What is the max theoretical TPS for an Arbitrum Chain?","answer": "Max TPS is a challenging metric to measure, as it relies on network activity and the type of submitted transactions. We can, however, calculate the max throughput using default orbit chain parameters.\n\nThe actual maximum throughput depends on the configurable execution parameters:\n\n**Using standard Arbitrum chain defaults**\n\n- Block time: 250ms\n- Block gas limit: 32M L2 gas\n- Max L2 gas per second: 128M gas/sec\n- These parameters are entirely configurable, for example, by dropping the block time to 100ms or by increasing the block gas limit (which comes at the cost of faster state bloat).\n- Dropping to 100ms and doubling the block gas limit to 64m L2 gas would achieve 640m L2 gas per second.\n**The actual TPS varies depending on the gas cost per transaction:**\n\n- A simple transfer (~21,000 gas) could approximately achieve around 6,000 TPS.\n- A more complex transaction (~200,000 gas) would enable approximately 640 TPS.\n","key": "what-is-the-max-theoretical-tps-for-an-arbitrum-chain"},
{"question": "Why is the WETH Gateway not necessary for custom gas token chains?","answer": "The `WETH` gateway used in the token bridge is a special, custom gateway that unwraps the `WETH` deposits and sends them to the Arbitrum chain, then wraps them again on the Arbitrum chain. Since `ETH` is the gas token in the Arbitrum (Orbit) chain, there's no need to perform this operation, so you can use a standard `ERC-20` for `WETH` (this is the default case of the token bridge so that you wouldn't need a special `WETH` gateway).\n\nIf you want to enable extra custom operations with `WETH`, you can create a custom token and a custom gateway to handle this case.\n\n","key": "why-is-the-weth-gateway-not-necessary-for-custom-gas-token-chains"},
{"question": "How do we verify if an ERC-20 was bridged using the native bridge?","answer": "The following applies to a parent-side bridge deployed on Arbitrum One:\nIf the token was bridged using the native token bridge, you can go to [parent_side_bridge_contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ERC20Gateway.sol#L47)\n\n\n\nCall the `calculateL2TokenAddress` address with the address of the token on the parent chain.\n\n\nFor example, in the case of plugging in the `USDT` address on Arbitrum One `0xfd086bc7cd5c481dcc9c85ebe478a1c0b69fcbb9`, you get `0xB2C565cd7e807e6A1C38bFE32D8FAb9c96ffCeCa`.\n\n","key": "how-do-we-verify-if-an-erc20-was-bridged-using-the-native-bridge"},

{"question": "What are the different validator modes?","answer": "- **Defensive (allowlist required)**:- Post stake and create a challenge if local state disagrees with the onchain assertion (wallet required, will only post stake onchain if a bad assertion is found.\n\n- **StakeLatest (allowlist required)**:- Stay staked on the latest assertion and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time new assertion created)\n\n- **ResolveNodes (allowlist required)**:- Stay staked on the latest assertion, resolve any unconfirmed assertions, and challenge any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, uses some gas every time an unconfirmed assertion is resolved or a new assertion is created)\n\n- **MakeNodes (allowlist required)**:- Continuously create new assertions, challenging any bad assertions found (wallet required, always staked, most expensive node to run)\n- Note that if there is more than one MakeNodes validator running, they might all try to create a new assertion at the same time. In that case, only one will be successful, and the others will have still spent gas on reverted calls that did nothing.\n\n- **Watchtower**:- A node in Watchtower mode will immediately log an error if an onchain assertion deviates from the locally computed chain state.

{"question": "What is the amount of funds that a validator needs in its wallet to participate in fraud proofs?","answer": "To participate in a fraud-proof game, your validator will need funds (can be any `ERC-20`) for two things:\n\n1. Gas costs to post assertions- Depends on your parent chain and is estimated to cost 163109 gas per assertion. If you assume one assertion per hour, then you can multiply your gas cost per hour to calculate the annual cost. This assumption holds under normal operation, but during a challenge, you may post more assertions (these will scale with the number of challenges), so it might be one assertion every 10 minutes, depending on how many challenges are ongoing.\n\n2. Bonds to participate- Depends on your config. You can set the bond amounts to be any amount you want. For Arbitrum One, this is 3600 `ETH` initially and then 555+79 `ETH` per each subsequent challenge. These amounts were carefully selected and designed, with extensive research behind them, specifically for Arbitrum One. There could be one or multiple challenges, and so there will always be a possibility where more funds are needed.\n\n","key": "what-is-the-amount-of-funds-that-a-validator-needs-in-its-wallet-to-participate-in-fraud-proofs"},

{"question": "What happens if I don't post an assertion for a long period of time?","answer": "Over time, without creating assertions, the validator whitelist in the Rollup contract can become disabled. If you look at the `[removeWhitelistAfterValidatorAfk](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L62)` method, it allows you to disable the whitelist after `confirmPeriodBlocks + VALIDATOR_AFK_BLOCKS` L1 blocks have passed since the last assertion created.\n\nAs a default, that's 7200 + 45818 blocks (a bit less than eight days). Disabling the whitelist is not a significant issue if you continue to monitor the chain and run a validator. It can be enabled using `[setValidatorWhitelistDisabled()](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/RollupAdminLogic.sol#L378)` by the chain owner.
