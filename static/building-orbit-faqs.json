    "question": "What fee collectors can be configured on my chain?",
    "answer": "Four fee types are configurable on an Arbitrum chain:\n\n- **L2 base fee**: L2 execution fees corresponding to the minimum base price of the chain. This fee is deposited into the `infraFeeAccount`, which can be set by calling `ArbOwner.setInfraFeeAccount().`\n- **L2 surplus fee**: L2 execution fees above the minimum base price (in the case of congestion). This fee goes to the `networkFeeAccount`, which can be set by calling `ArbOwner.setNetworkFeeAccount().`\n- **L1 base fee**: Relative fees for posting a transaction on the parent chain. This fee is paid ultimately to the fee collector of the active batch poster. A call to `SequencerInbox.setIsBatchPoster()` on the parent chain will set the batch poster. Delegating a different fee collector for that batch poster can be specified by calling `ArbAggregator.setFeeCollector()`.\n- **L1 surplus fee**: Any extra fees rewarded to the batch poster.

    "answer": "**Warning: Always test first!!!**\n\nTest this thoroughly on a testnet first.\n\n1. This is a hard limit in the codebase to prevent DoS attacks.

Other limits might also need to be updated, such as the maximum decompressed batch size. Be sure to modify everything starting with the latest version, which includes a couple of extra safety checks that may help prevent issues.\n2. You could disable this limit if you were confident you would stick to AnyTrust and not need to fall back to posting data onchain.\n3.

    "question": "What is the max theoretical TPS for an Arbitrum Chain?",
    "answer": "Max TPS is a challenging metric to measure, as it relies on network activity and the type of submitted transactions. We can, however, calculate the max throughput using default Arbitrum chain parameters.\n\nThe actual maximum throughput depends on the configurable execution parameters:\n\n**Using standard Arbitrum chain defaults**\n\n- Block time: 250ms\n- Block gas limit: 32M L2 gas\n- Max L2 gas per second: 128M gas/sec\n- These parameters are entirely configurable, for example, by dropping the block time to 100ms or by increasing the block gas limit (which comes at the cost of faster state bloat).\n- Dropping to 100ms and doubling the block gas limit to 64m L2 gas would achieve 640m L2 gas per second.\n**The actual TPS varies depending on the gas cost per transaction:**\n\n- A simple transfer (~21,000 gas) could approximately achieve around 6,000 TPS.\n- A more complex transaction (~200,000 gas) would enable approximately 640 TPS.\n",

    "question": "Why is the WETH Gateway not necessary for custom gas token chains?",
    "answer": "The `WETH` gateway used in the token bridge is a special, custom gateway that unwraps the `WETH` deposits and sends them to the Arbitrum chain, then wraps them again on the Arbitrum chain. Since `ETH` is the gas token in the Arbitrum chain, there's no need to perform this operation, so you can use a standard `ERC-20` for `WETH` (this is the default case of the token bridge so that you wouldn't need a special `WETH` gateway).\n\nIf you want to enable extra custom operations with `WETH`, you can create a custom token and a custom gateway to handle this case.\n\n",

In that case, only one will be successful, and the others will have still spent gas on reverted calls that did nothing.\n\n- **Watchtower**:- A node in Watchtower mode will immediately log an error if an onchain assertion deviates from the locally computed chain state.

    "answer": "To participate in a fraud-proof game, your validator will need funds (can be any `ERC-20`) for two things:\n\n1. Gas costs to post assertions- Depends on your parent chain and is estimated to cost 163109 gas per assertion. If you assume one assertion per hour, then you can multiply your gas cost per hour to calculate the annual cost. This assumption holds under normal operation, but during a challenge, you may post more assertions (these will scale with the number of challenges), so it might be one assertion every 10 minutes, depending on how many challenges are ongoing.\n\n2. Bonds to participate- Depends on your config. You can set the bond amounts to be any amount you want. For Arbitrum One, this is 3600 `ETH` initially and then 555+79 `ETH` per each subsequent challenge. These amounts were carefully selected and designed, with extensive research behind them, specifically for Arbitrum One. There could be one or multiple challenges, and so there will always be a possibility where more funds are needed.\n\n",
