    "question": "When building Orbit L2 and Orbit L3 on the mainnet, the advantages of L3 over L2 appear limited to lower gas fees, no Arbitrum DAO approval, and no license fee.

    "answer": "The choice between Orbit L2 and L3 mainly depends on customization needs and settlement preferences. \n\nSome common points of confusion first:\n• **Arbitrum DAO approval:** Not required for Orbit L2 or L3.\n• **AEP license fee:** Applies only if the chain settles directly to Ethereum or any other parent chain. Avoided when settling to Arbitrum One or Nova.\n• **Finality & gas fees:** Comparable for L2 and L3 when using the same parent chain; AnyTrust mode provides low fees for both.\n\n**Key advantages of Orbit L3:**\n1. **Cost optimization:** Avoids AEP license fees by settling to Arbitrum One/Nova instead of Ethereum (**USP of L3**)\n2. **Customization:** Greater flexibility in settlement and configuration options, especially when leveraging a parent chain's AnyTrust setup.\n3. **Performance:** Faster, cheaper bridging to its parent chain.\n4. **Ecosystem alignment:** Stronger integration with the Arbitrum ecosystem, benefiting from shared tooling and potential ecosystem support.",

    "question": "What is the theoretical maximum tps officially announced by Arbitrum and the prerequisites for it, and What is the realistic maximum tps possible in Arbitrum One and the prerequisites for it?",
    "answer": "In general we prefer to use throughput (gas /s) over TPS, as TPS is dependent on the transaction type. So for any throughput value you can just divide by the gas of your transaction to get TPS (standard is to use `eth_call` which is 22K gas)\n\n**OFFICIAL TPS:**the maximum official TPS for an orbit chain is, ~14,500 TPS:\n• 32M block gas limit\n• 100ms block times\n• eth_call transactions (22,000 gas/tx)\n• Standard hardwareThis value is useful for PEAK load that can be sustained. In practice, prices start to rise and demand slows down\n\n**REALISTIC TPS:**Taking historical data, during Arbitrum One's highest period of sustained peak usage, Arbitrum One operated at 50M gas/s for several hours. With modifications, several Orbit chains have sustained 100Mgas/s over multiple days with peaks of 400Mgas/s. These chains are built on AnyTrust DA which is our lowest cost configuration for an Orbit chainThe limitation in realistic cases is that higher gas prices caused users to delay their transactions, the hardware/chain operated completely normally.\n\nIt's worth noting, two major focuses on our roadmap:\n**1. Scalability**: We have several projects that will improve scalability to ensure Orbit chains can reach 100Megagas/s throughput (10^8 gas units, ~14.2x higher than the current sustainable limit).\n    a.

Additionally, when comparing Rollup and AnyTrust configurations—specifically L2 Rollup + L3 Rollup versus L2 Rollup + L3 AnyTrust—how do transaction fees differ on the L3?",
    "answer": "The only project that is an L3 AnyTrust chain settling on top of an L2 AnyTrust is Playblock. However, we don't encourage this setup.\n\nIn Arbitrum's design, transaction fees are determined by a **two-dimensional gas model**, consisting of:\n1. **Execution cost:** The fee paid on the child chain for computation, storage, and execution resources.\n2. **Data availability (DA) cost:** The fee paid on the parent chain for posting transaction data to ensure it is recorded and verifiable.\nWhen execution costs are comparable, the total transaction fee difference primarily depends on the **data availability layer** used. \n\n**AnyTrust mode** provides significantly lower DA costs than **Rollup mode**, so an **L3 AnyTrust chain** will generally have lower fees than an **L3 Rollup chain**, regardless of whether the parent L2 uses Rollup or AnyTrust.\n\nRefer explanation doc [here](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9).",

    "question": "Is it possible for an Orbit chain to process 1 billion transactions per day (over 10,000 TPS) by adjusting parameters such as block time, gas limit per block, or gas limit per second?",
    "answer": "Simply increasing configuration parameters like block time or gas limits provides only **limited performance improvement (And this can onlu higher upper limit)**,  as the main bottleneck lies in **EVM execution speed** and **node performance (determines lower limit)**. Additionally, the **minimum gas cost per on-chain transaction (21,000 gas)** is fixed by the EVM and cannot be reduced.\n\nTo achieve higher throughput, it is recommended to:\n• **Aggregate transactions** before submitting them on-chain.\n• **Move computation off-chain** and store only the resulting state on-chain.\n• Utilize **Stylus (EVM+)**, which significantly improves execution efficiency and can help achieve higher TPS.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, an Orbit chain with **default parameters** achieves a **maximum theoretical throughput of around 6,095 TPS**, but this can be configured up to **approximately 15,238 TPS** (benchmarked against `eth_call` transactions). \n\nMaximum TPS is primarily governed by two parameters:\n• **Block time:** Default is 250 ms, configurable down to 100 ms (a 2.5× increase in TPS).\n• **Gas limit per block:** Default is 32,000,000 gas, and increasing this further boosts TPS but also accelerates **state growth**.\n\nHowever, it's important to distinguish between **theoretical and practical performance**. In real-world conditions, considering hardware, network latency, and system overhead, an Orbit chain typically achieves **400–700 TPS**, or roughly **33–60 million transactions per day**.\n\nAny claims of **billion-scale daily on-chain throughput** should therefore be viewed skeptically, as such performance is not technically achievable within realistic system and EVM constraints.",

    "question": "Isn't L3 generally understood to be cheaper than L2?                                        What are the technical advantages of choosing L3 regarding customizability, performance, operational differences, and service operation based on platform experience?",
    "answer": "For any Nitro chain is **execution plus data availability (DA)** . The main difference between Orbit L2 and L3 lies in the **settlement layer** (the parent chain), since both use the same **Nitro stack**. The assumption that L3 is cheaper is mostly outdated as both L2 and L3 **can** use **AnyTrust mode**, which allows for similarly low gas fees. However with rollup mode, the dominant cost is L1 data posting.\n\n**Gas Fees:**\nTransaction costs depend primarily on **data availability (DA)** rather than on whether a chain is L2 or L3. Since both can adopt AnyTrust DA, their fees are generally comparable. L3 is therefore not inherently cheaper than L2. Since the DAcert from an L3 will be posted on the L2 which will then be posted to the L1.\n\nEven in rollup mode, the pricing difference between L2 and L3 for gas fees are very similar, since when data is posted to the L2 from the L3, the L2 still needs to post that data to the L1 for DA. meaning even on L3 you will still be paying L2 and L1 DA fees.\n\n**One small point to note:**\n• If it's an L3 chain, the data will be posted to L2 first, afterwards it will be posted to L1 by the L2 chain.\n• If it's an L2 chain, then the data will be posted directly to L1. \n\n**Technical and Operational Advantages of L3:**\n• **Settlement Flexibility:** L3 can settle on an L2 such as Arbitrum One or Nova\n• **No AEP License Fee:** Chains settling on Arbitrum One or Nova avoid the AEP license fee that applies to L2s settling directly to Ethereum.",

    "question": "If building an Orbit L3 chain designed to handle around 1 billion transactions per day (approximately 12,000 TPS assuming even distribution), how many feed relays, full nodes, sequencer relays, sequencers, and validators would be required? The assumption is 80% write activity, 10% execution, and 10% read activity. Can the High-Availability Sequencer Architecture support this throughput?",
    "answer": "The High-Availability Sequencer Architecture is designed to he more reliable than a normal sequencer in that its cannot fail to a single fault point. Before estimating node counts, it is important to understand how **full nodes** and **sequencers** share responsibilities:\n• **Read operations (calls):**\n\nRead-only queries are handled directly by full nodes without involving the sequencer. Read capacity scales horizontally—adding more full nodes increases read throughput. On average, a full node can handle around **1,000–1,500 read requests per second**. To support **10,000 RPS**, roughly **8–10 full nodes** would be needed, with additional nodes recommended for redundancy and traffic spikes.\n• **Write operations (transactions):**\n\nAll transactions are sent from full nodes to the sequencer, which orders and executes them. Only the sequencer determines transaction ordering, while full nodes follow and execute in that sequence. Write throughput does **not** scale with the number of full nodes; it is constrained by the **sequencer's single-threaded performance** and the ability of full nodes to keep up.\n\nThe current Arbitrum network sustains around **7–12 million gas per second**, translating to roughly **500–600 simple ETH transfers per second.** Actual performance will vary depending on hardware, configuration, and transaction complexity.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n• **Read capacity** can be increased by running additional full nodes.\n• **Write capacity** depends on the sequencer's processing power rather than the number of nodes. Along with the power of the full nodes, since they need to be able to keep up with the sequencers transactions.\n• The **High-Availability Sequencer Architecture** can be modified for more reliability within the network.",

    "question": "How does the sequencer handle transaction surges? For instance, if 100,000 transactions are submitted simultaneously, will all be processed eventually, or will some fail? Additionally, in such cases, is it necessary to use Retryable Tickets to ensure reliable processing?",
    "answer": "The sequencer maintains an internal **transaction queue** to handle incoming transactions. When multiple valid and properly priced transactions arrive simultaneously, they are placed in this queue and processed sequentially over subsequent blocks until the backlog clears. The queue can hold approximately **1,000 transactions by default**, and any remaining transactions will get rejected if they cannot get in the queue within 12 seconds.\n\nSince the **EVM executes transactions sequentially**, the sequencer can process only one transaction at a time. Transactions can fail in the sequencer or during execution. They will fail in the sequencer if a transaction has an incorrect nonce, incorrect signature, insufficient funds, anything that can be checked before execution which will lead to the transaction never being executed. Transactions can also fail mid execution do to reverting which can happen for many many reasons. In cases of sustained congestion, underpriced transactions may be dropped, requiring resubmission with a higher fee.\n\nThe **queue timeout** is roughly **12 seconds **by default, after which unprocessed transactions may be removed if not yet included in a block.\n\n**Retryable Tickets** are *not* used for standard user transactions within an Orbit chain. They are designed for **cross-chain communication** (e.g., L1 → L2 or L2 → L3) to provide a censorship-resistant fallback path, not for managing local transaction load or congestion.\n\nFor setups requiring guaranteed service continuity, refer to the [High-Availability Sequencer documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/sequencer/high-availability-sequencer-docs).",

    "answer": "The **7 M Gas/s** is a **soft limit**, not a hard cap. It represents the sustainable throughput target. If the network gas usage exceeds this value, the gas price increases to moderate demand, but transactions can still exceed the soft limit.\n\n• The observed **1,358 TPS** reflects real-world transactions where blocks may temporarily exceed the soft limit, and transactions vary in gas cost, allowing higher throughput than a simple calculation .\n• The **theoretical maximum TPS of 40,000** assumes idealized conditions with **unlimited hardware performance**, minimal transaction gas, and optimal block settings.\n• **Hard limits** are defined by node parameters, e.g., minimum block time of 0.25 s and max gas per block of 32 M, which would theoretically allow up to 128 M gas/s.\n\nSoft limits regulate network congestion, while hard limits define absolute technical boundaries.",

    "question": "What portion of the transaction fee serves as sequencer revenue (e.g., L1/L2 gas, base, and congestion fees)?In an Orbit L3 chain, the batch poster posts to its parent chain (L2). It appears that part of the L3 transaction fee is deposited to the batch poster's L2 address. How exactly is the user-paid transaction fee routed to the batch poster's address?",
    "answer": "Refer [docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-arbitrum-chain/configure-your-chain/advanced-configurations/aep-fee-router/calculate-aep-fees#sequencing-revenue) for sequencer revenue\n\nThe sequencer's revenue and fee flow are determined by how the Orbit chain's fee components are configured. There are four main fee types on an Orbit chain:\n\n1. **L2 Base Fee:**\nThis represents the minimum execution fee for processing transactions on the chain. It is deposited into the **infraFeeAccount**, which can be configured via `ArbOwner.setInfraFeeAccount()`.\n\n2. **L2 Surplus Fee:**\nWhen the network experiences congestion and users pay above the base fee, the surplus portion is directed to the **networkFeeAccount**, set through `ArbOwner.setNetworkFeeAccount()`.\n\n3. **L1 Base Fee:**\nThis covers the cost of posting transaction batches to the parent chain. These funds are ultimately paid to the **fee collector** of the **active batch poster**. The batch poster is designated using `SequencerInbox.setIsBatchPoster()` on the parent chain, and its fee collector can be set via `ArbAggregator.setFeeCollector()`.Note: These payments occur **on the child chain**, even though the costs correspond to activity on the parent chain.\n\n4. **L1 Surplus Fee:**\nAny additional rewards associated with batch posting are paid to a specific **L1RewardRecipient**, which can be configured via `ArbOwner.setL1PricingRewardRecipient()`.\n\nIn summary, part of the transaction fee that users pay on the child chain is allocated to cover the posting cost. Then tge fee is directed to the those configured **address** on child chain(or its configured fee collector) as reimbursement for posting batches to the parent chain.\n\nFor more details on fee distribution, please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/gas-fees#parent-chain-costs).",

    "question": "What are the current hardware specifications of the nodes that make up Arbitrum one, which is currently being operated by offchain labs?(sequencer, validator, full node, relay, etc.)",
    "answer": "Most of our instances run on a cloud provider and we use Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment and management of services. As a reminder, Arbitrum One is unique: it was the first L2 blockchain to launch and has been in production for over 3 years. The types of applications and what users do on Arbitrum One is likely to be very different from any other chain and so I'd ask that you keep this in mind while comparing your chain's hardware configurations and performance.\n\n• Our sequencer runs a minimum of: 10 CPU cores, 90GB of RAM, and a fairly large local NVMe drive, specifically ~6.6TB in size. On AWS, we use `i7ie.3xlarge`.\n• The archive node runs on: 2 CPU cores, 40GB RAM, and a large 16TB `gp3` high iops volume\n• Validators run on a minimum of 3 CPU cores, 32GB RAM, and a 4TB `gp3` high iops volume\n• Regular RPC nodes we run are roughly 4 CPU cores and 32GB RAM.\n\n Note that most professional node operators for RPC nodes (e.g. Alchemy, Infura, Quicknode, etc) run way larger machines to serve RPC calls because those companies sell RPC-as-a-service for their business and so they have higher requirements for uptime and performance. We do not do that since we do not serve high volume, production calls on our RPC nodes - our RPC nodes are public and free and therefore have a lower requirement for all those things i mention above (latency, perf, uptime, etc)\n\nFor setting up own chain, we do recommend HA set ups. [This repository of helm charts might be valuable to your team](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/community-helm-charts). Again, we want to emphasize that these specifications are for Arbitrum One and its demand/load profile. A new chain or a different chain will have a different demand/load profile and set of users and apps that may mean your chain will use more or less than what Arbitrum One uses. Generally, I believe that better hardware and better configurations/setups in your DevOps environment lead to better outcomes: being able to handle more throughput, transactions, and offering better latency.We're continuously and currently doing optimization work to both increase performance for the same hardware, as well as doing benchmarking to see what performance and throughput look like at higher hardware tiers.",

Increase Queue Capacity**\n• Scale `queue-size` to accommodate peak transaction loads\n• Monitor queue utilization metrics to determine appropriate sizing\n• Consider your RAM constraints when setting large queue sizes\n**2. Pre-Submission Rate Limiting**\n• Implement rate limiting on the client side \n• Match submission rate to your Sequencer's processing capacity\n• Prevents queue overflow before it happens**\nCaveats & Important Notes**\n⚠️ **No Built-in Overflow Protection:** Once the queue is full, new transactions are rejected. There's no automatic spillover mechanism.\n⚠️ **Memory Constraints:** Very large queue sizes consume significant RAM. Ensure your infrastructure can support the configured queue size.\n\nThis might solve your problems here, but if you will accept a large number of tx at the same time, having a **customized relayer** cache will be better.",

Check L1 Pending Transaction**\nView the validator address on L1 to inspect the stuck transaction:bash\n\n*`# Using Etherscan or similar block explorer# Or query via RPC:`*`\neth_getTransactionByHash <tx_hash_for_nonce_30>`\n**2. Identify Root Cause**\n**a. Gas Price Too Low (Most Common)**\n• Transaction gas price is too low for current L1 network conditions\n• L1 miners/validators won't prioritize it\n• **Solution:** Increase gas price configuration\n**b. Severe L1 Network Congestion**\n• L1 network is extremely congested\n• Even reasonable gas prices are stuck\n• **Solution:** Significantly increase gas price or wait for congestion to clear\nc**. RPC Node Problem**\n• L1 RPC node may not be properly broadcasting the transaction\n• Transaction might not actually be in mempool\n• **Solution:** Verify RPC endpoint health, consider switching providers**\nSolution Options\nOption 1: Increase Mempool Size (Allow System to Continue)**\nThis lets the validator submit new assertions even while nonce 30 is stuck:\n**For legacy validators:**bash\n\n`--node.staker.data-poster.max-mempool-transactions=10`\n**For BOLD validators:**bash\n\n`--node.bold.data-poster.max-mempool-transactions=10`\n**Trade-off:** More capital locked in pending transactions, but assertions continue**\nOption 2: Increase Gas Price Configuration**\nMake transactions more competitive on L1:\n\n*`# Increase base gas price`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.target-price-gwei\n\n`*`# Increase urgency multiplier`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.urgency-gwei\n\n`*`# Increase max tip`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.max-tip-cap-gwei`**\nOption 3: Manually Accelerate Stuck Transaction**\nIf nonce 30 is genuinely stuck, use Replace-By-Fee (RBF):\n**Steps:**\n1. Get transaction details for nonce 30\n2. Send replacement transaction with:\n\n    ◦ **Same nonce:** 30\n    ◦ **Higher gas price:** At least 10% increase\n    ◦ **Same transaction data**\n**Note:** DataPoster should handle this automatically, but if `replacement-times` is configured too conservatively, manual intervention may be needed.\n**Check replacement configuration:**\n\n*`# Default: 5m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 1h, ...# For faster replacement:`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.replacement-times=\"2m,5m,10m,20m\"`**\nOption 4: Check DataPoster Status**\nMonitor DataPoster internal state:bash\n\n*`# If metrics are enabled:`*`\ncurl http://localhost:6070/debug/metrics/prometheus | grep dataposter\n\n`*`# Key metrics to watch:# - arb_dataposter_latest_unconfirmed_nonce# - arb_dataposter_balance# - arb_dataposter_pending_transactions`***\nRecommended Complete Configuration**\nFor validators experiencing persistent stuck transactions:\n\n*`# Allow multiple pending transactions`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.max-mempool-transactions=10\n\n`*`# More aggressive gas pricing`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.target-price-gwei\n--node.staker.data-poster.urgency-gwei\n--node.staker.data-poster.max-tip-cap-gwei\n\n`*`# Faster replacement cycle`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.replacement-times=\"3m,6m,12m,20m,30m\"\n\n`*`# Wait for L1 finality (recommended for security)`*`\n--node.staker.data-poster.wait-for-l1-finality=true`\n**For BOLD validators:** Usually replace `--node.staker` with `--node.bold` in all flags above.",

We can also implement a pre-checker mechanism on these nodes to further reduce sequencer pressure. Provide them with all node endpoints so they distribute transactions across multiple nodes rather than sending everything to one.\n3. **Deploy a High Availability sequencer setup** - If they're doing stress testing, this prevents downtime from sequencer failures.\n4. **Use only 1 validator** - Sufficient for this testing scenario.\n5. **Increase speed limit** (and adjust related speed limit parameters accordingly) - Allows for higher throughput at lower gas prices.\n6. **Set `minL2BaseFee` to 0.0001.**\n7. **Increase batch size - **This can slightly reduces the per-transaction cost by amortizing L1 posting costs across more transactions.\n8. **Deploy on a private chain with low gas - **If deploying the L3 on a private L2, we can set low gas prices to this private chain. However, there's a tradeoff: testing costs will be lower than production costs once migrated to mainnet, which could lead to inaccurate cost projections.\n9. Can deploy chain as Anytrust.\n**Smart Contract Deployment Recommendations:**Beyond node configuration, we should recommend they deploy their core business contracts as:\n1. **Stylus contracts** - This can dramatically reduce gas costs & increase TPS and works well for business logic contracts.\n2. **Precompile contracts** - Precompiles allow custom gas cost settings, enabling further cost reduction.

Leadership Keys**\n• `coordinator.chosen` - URL of currently active sequencer (e.g., \"[http://sequencer1:8547](http://sequencer1:8547/)\")\n• `coordinator.liveliness.<url>` - Each sequencer's heartbeat signal\n**2. Message Synchronization**\n• `coordinator.msgCount` - Current message count (signed)\n• `coordinator.finalizedMsgCount` - Finalized message count (signed)\n• `coordinator.msg.<index>` - Individual messages (JSON encoded)\n• Other sync-related keys\n**3. Configuration**\n• `coordinator.priorities` - Comma-separated priority list of sequencer URLs\n\n**The election process:**\n1. The system reads coordinator.priorities to get the ordered list of sequencer URLs\n2. It checks each URL in priority order to see if that sequencer has set coordinator.liveliness.<url> = \"OK\"\n3. The first sequencer in the priority list that has its liveliness key set becomes the recommended leader\n4. That sequencer attempts to acquire the coordinator.chosen lock **Conditions for a sequencer to become active:**\n• Must be synced with the network\n• Must have processed all messages up to the current count\n• Must successfully acquire the coordinator.chosen lock before it expires\n• The lock uses Redis transactions (optimistic locking) to prevent race conditions\n\nRedis and sequencer coordinator doesn't do traditional load balancing here - it's more of a **failover mechanism, Only ONE sequencer is active at a time (holding the coordinator.chosen lock)**",
