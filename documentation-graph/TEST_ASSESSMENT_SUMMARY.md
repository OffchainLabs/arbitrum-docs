## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: üî¥ HIGH

#### Critical Risks

1. **Untested Core Logic** - Graph building and analysis have no tests
2. **Broken CI/CD** - 198 failing tests prevent continuous integration
3. **Refactoring Risk** - No confidence in making changes to core components
4. **Technical Debt** - Tests not maintained, accumulating problems

#### Impact

- Cannot safely refactor core components
- Risk of regressions in production
- Slower development velocity
- Lower code quality confidence

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Stabilization (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Restore test suite to passing state

- Fix all 198 failing tests
- Add minimum viable tests for graph components
- Configure CI pipeline
- **Target:** 100% pass rate, >50% coverage

### Phase 2: Enhancement (4 weeks)

**Goal:** Achieve comprehensive coverage

- Complete graph component testing
- Add integration tests
- Implement performance benchmarks
- **Target:** >70% coverage

### Phase 3: Excellence (6 weeks)

**Goal:** Industry-leading test quality

- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing (>75% score)
- Test automation and monitoring
- **Target:** >80% coverage

**Total Duration:** 12 weeks
**Total Effort:** 326 hours

## Test Infrastructure

### Current Setup

```json
{
  "testFramework": "Jest",
  "testEnvironment": "Node.js",
  "coverageThreshold": "50% (documentation-graph) / 75% (mcp-server)",
  "integrationTests": "Partial",
  "cicdPipeline": "Not configured",
  "preCommitHooks": "Not configured"
}
```

### Recommended Improvements

- Add GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Configure pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- Add coverage reporting (Codecov)
- Implement test result tracking
- Add performance regression detection

---

## Key Findings

### Excellent Practices Found

1. **TDD in MCP Server** - Tests written first, well-documented RED phase
2. **Clear Test IDs** - Systematic naming (DP-U-001, SC-U-001)
3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases** - MCP server tests cover edge cases extensively
4. **Good Test Structure** - Proper use of describe blocks, fixtures, beforeEach

### Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Test Maintenance** - Tests not updated with implementation changes
2. **Core Component Coverage** - Critical components completely untested
3. **Integration Testing** - Limited end-to-end pipeline tests
4. **Performance Testing** - Minimal benchmarking and stress testing
5. **CI/CD Integration** - No automated test enforcement
