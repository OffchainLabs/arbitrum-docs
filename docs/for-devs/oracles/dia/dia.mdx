[DIA](https://www.diadata.org/) is a trustless oracle network delivering verifiable, customizable data feeds for any asset. DIA sources raw data directly from primary markets and computes it onchain via its proprietary rollup, ensuring full transparency and data integrity.

### Querying the price of `ARB` through DIA

Call the getValue(string memory key) function on the oracle contract with the Query Symbol (e.g., "ARB/USD"). The function returns the asset price with 8 decimal precision and the timestamp of the last update.

Solidity Example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface IDIAOracleV2 {
    function getValue(string memory) external view returns (uint128,
             uint128);
}

contract DIAOracleSample {

    /**
    * @notice The DIA oracle to read from.
    * Oracle Address: "0x..."
    * Network: Arbitrum Sepolia
    */
    address constant diaOracle = "0x...";

    function getPrice(string memory key)
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint128 latestPrice,
        uint128 timestampOflatestPrice
    ) {
        (latestPrice, timestampOflatestPrice) =
                 IDIAOracleV2(diaOracle).getValue(key);
    }
}
```
