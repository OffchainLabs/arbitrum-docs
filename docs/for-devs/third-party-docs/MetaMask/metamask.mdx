The [MetaMask Delegation Toolkit](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/) is a collection of tools for embedding
MetaMask Smart Accounts into dapps.
These [smart accounts](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/concepts/smart-accounts/) support programmable
account behavior and advanced features like delegated permissions, multi-signature approvals, and gas abstraction.

[Delegations](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/concepts/delegation/) are a core feature of MetaMask Smart
Accounts, enabling secure, rule-based permission sharing.
These delegations are powered by the toolkit's Delegation Framework, which defines how permissions are created, shared,
and enforced.

## Using MetaMask Smart Accounts with Arbitrum

The latest version of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit
[supports multiple networks](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/get-started/supported-networks/), including
Arbitrum and Arbitrum Sepolia.

You can follow the
[MetaMask Smart Accounts quickstart](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/development/get-started/quickstart/) to
set up the toolkit, create a smart account, and send a user operation.
Make sure you import `arbitrum` or `arbitrumSepolia` from `viem/chains` when setting up the Public Client.
