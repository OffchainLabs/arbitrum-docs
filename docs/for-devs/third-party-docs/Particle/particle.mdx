[Particle Network](https://particle.network) enables **chain abstraction** through its **Universal Accounts** (UA) infrastructure. This gives users a single unified account and balance across [multiple chains](https://developers.particle.network/universal-accounts/cha/chains#supported-networks). This means that a user can interact with your dApp on **Arbitrum** even if their assets are located on a completely different chain.

**Universal Accounts** unify EVM and non-EVM ecosystems under one identity.
This allows:

- Cross-chain deposits and swaps without manual bridging.
- Unified balance fetching across chains.
- Gas abstraction: users can pay fees in any [supported token](https://developers.particle.network/universal-accounts/cha/chains#primary-assets).

**Arbitrum** is one of the earliest networks supported by Universal Accounts, with full support for **cross-chain transactions**, **unified balances**, and **universal gas**

## Why this matters for your deposit flow

Traditional deposit flows require users to choose a chain, bridge tokens, and manage gas tokens on that chain, all of which introduce friction and drop-offs. With Universal Accounts, your dApp on Arbitrum can accept deposits from **any supported chain** (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Solana, etc), and the user's balance is unified behind the scenes.

That means:

- One deposit address per user.
- No bridging steps, no chain switching required.
- Simpler UX for the user; fewer errors, fewer abandoned flows.
- Your contract infrastructure can live on Arbitrum without worrying about which chain the user's assets happen to be on.

## Getting Started

This tutorial shows how to build a **Next.js** app using the [Universal Accounts SDK](https://developers.particle.network/universal-accounts/cha/web-quickstart) to:

- Fetch the unified balance
- Accept deposits from _any chain_
- Send a cross-chain transaction

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn or npm
- Basic familiarity with React / Next.js

### Start from the starter app

Start from the starter app with the authentication logic ([Particle Connect](https://developers.particle.network/social-logins/connect/introduction)) already implemented on [GitHub](https://github.com/Particle-Network/connectkit-starter).

> Note that we use Particle Connect for authentication, but you can use any other provider or browser wallet.

### 1. Install Dependencies

After you initialize the starter app, you'll need the Universal Accounts SDK for cross-chain logic.

```bash
yarn add @particle-network/universal-account-sdk ethers
```

> Note that `ethers.js` is a dependency of the Universal Accounts SDK, but you can use any other library to interact with the blockchain.

### 2. Configure the Particle Dashboard

Go to the [Particle Dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/) and create a new project to get your credentials.

You'll need:

- `projectId`
- `clientKey`
- `appId`

Store these in your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='YOUR_CLIENT_KEY'
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='YOUR_APP_ID'
```

### 3. Initialize a Universal Account

The Universal Account is the core object that enables cross-chain logic, and it's a smart account owned by the user's EOA.

After login, create a Universal Account instance tied to that user's EOA.

```typescript
import { UniversalAccount } from '@particle-network/universal-account-sdk';
const { address } = useAccount();

const universalAccountInstance = new UniversalAccount({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,
  ownerAddress: address!, // The EOA from login from Particle Connect useAccount hook
});
```

This object enables:

- Fetching the Universal Account addresses.
- Querying the unified balance.
- Sending cross-chain transactions.

### 4. Fetch Addresses and Balances

The Universal Account SDK provides a few methods to fetch the user's balance and addresses.

```typescript
// Universal Account addresses. One for EVM assets and one for Solana assets
const universalAccountData = await universalAccountInstance.getSmartAccountOptions();
console.log('EVM Universal Account:', universalAccountData.evmSmartAccount);
console.log('Solana Universal Account:', universalAccountData.solanaSmartAccount);

// Primary assets aggregated across chains
const primaryAssets = await universalAccountInstance.getPrimaryAssets();

// Full breakdown of assets on all chains
console.log(primaryAssets);

// Total amount in USD
console.log(primaryAssets.totalAmountInUSD);
```

Here you retrieve the Universal Account addresses, and the user's **primary assets** aggregated across chains (e.g., `USDC`, `ETH`, `USDT`).

### 5. Interacting with your dApp

Your dApp runs on Arbitrum, but the user holds assets on another chain like **Base**, **Polygon**, or **Solana**. Thanks to Universal Accounts, you can still interact with your dApp.

In this example, we mint an NFT on Arbitrum, but the user can pay with any supported token from any chain:

```typescript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x702E0755450aFb6A72DbE3cAD1fb47BaF3AC525C'; // NFT contract on Arbitrum

const contractInterface = new Interface(['function mint() external']);

const transaction = await universalAccountInstance.createUniversalTransaction({
  chainId: CHAIN_ID.ARBITRUM_MAINNET_ONE,
  expectTokens: [],
  transactions: [
    {
      to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      data: contractInterface.encodeFunctionData('mint'),
      // value: "0x0",
    },
  ],
});
```

The `transaction` object contains all the transaction details, you only need to sign the `rootHash` returned and send it via the SDK:

```typescript
const signature = await walletClient?.signMessage({
  account: address as `0x${string}`,
  message: { raw: transaction.rootHash },
});

const result = await universalAccountInstance.sendTransaction(transaction, signature);
```

> This example shows how to use Particle Connect, but you can use any wallet client to sign the `rootHash`.

And you can use UniversalX as a block explorer to track the transaction:

`https://universalx.app/activity/details?id=${result.transactionId}`

The SDK handles fund routing so the user can pay with any supported token from any chain.

> Find a complete implementation of this example in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Particle-Network/universal-accounts-workshop-arbitrum/blob/949abdc011d66f97d7949dca9c26f2778fe503d1/workshop-completed/app/page.tsx#L87).

## Deposit Flow

The previous example demonstrates how to use **Universal Accounts** specifically to interact with a smart contract on **Arbitrum**, but a big use case is also to accept deposits directly from any chain and various assets:

Here's a simplified sequence when your Arbitrum dApp accepts assets from any chain:

1.  Get the user's UA deposit address (via `getSmartAccountOptions()`).
2.  Display it in your UI: "Send `USDC`/`USDT` from any supported chain."
3.  User sends on any chain (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Solana, etc).
4.  UA detects the deposit and credits it to the unified balance.
5.  User interacts with your dApp on Arbitrumâ€”UA automatically uses liquidity routing & abstracts gas.
6.  Your contract logic on Arbitrum receives/uses funds as if they were local.

No bridging step. No chain switching prompt. One unified experience.

## Putting It All Together

**Universal Accounts** turn multi-chain interaction into a single, unified experience.
By integrating them into your Arbitrum dApp, you're no longer limited by where a user's funds live.

Your app can accept deposits, perform swaps, and interact with smart contracts using liquidity from any supported chain.
