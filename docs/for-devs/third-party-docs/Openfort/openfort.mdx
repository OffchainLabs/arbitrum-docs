[Openfort](https://openfort.io) is an open-source wallet infrastructure built with authentication and payments. Openfort has developed an SDK that vertically integrates the creation of a wallet and the account abstraction technology all in one.

## [Embedded wallet](https://www.openfort.io/embedded-wallet)

Build for React, React Native, Swift, and Unity SDK. It enables app developers to onboard users and generate wallets for them. Features include:

- **Plug-and-play UI Components**: Prebuilt, customizable authentication and wallet connection flows that can be deployed in minutes, not weeks, with support for major authentication providers and wallet connector
- **Non-custodial Signer**: Secure, self-custodied wallet creation and signing for users, with no need for browser extensions or external apps.
- **Onramp Support**: Users can onramp their newly created wallets with traditional methods or depositing crypto.
- **Key Export**: Users can always export private keys, allowing them to take the wallet with them.

## [Global wallet](https://www.openfort.io/crossapp-wallet)

If you're building your own Arbitrum chain and are thinking about owning the wallet, connect with us. Global wallets are designed for you to have a universal sign-on across all the apps in your ecosystem.

- **Ecosystem SDK**: Build your own wallet SDK that can be integrated across your suite of apps, ensuring users have a consistent identity and asset management experience everywhere.
- **No App or Extension Required**: Users can create and use wallets instantly via iFrames or embedded flows, compatible with any EVM chain.
- **Modern Standards**: Supports the latest Ethereum standards (EIP-1193, 6963, 7702, 4337, and more) for broad compatibility and future-proofing.
