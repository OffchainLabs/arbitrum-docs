:::warning Action required

Arbitrum Sepolia node operators **must upgrade** to Nitro **`v3.9.3`** ahead of this activation to continue syncing the chain.

- **Release notes:** https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3

### Context

[ArbOS 51](docs/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51.mdx) is a follow-up to ArbOS 50 that fixes issues with the pricing framework. ArbOS 50 was previously activated on Sepolia, but the Gas Target & Pricing Framework changes remained disabled pending this fix. ArbOS 51 now completes that work.

Upstream governance items ([ArbOS 50](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x33754da4006d0ef38666ec5d5e85fd0966a891a594ab9dc21f23beedea2d330b) + [Gas Target & Pricing Framework](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5)) are being bundled into a single on-chain vote. Both components have passed Snapshot temperature checks, with the Tally vote expected to open on or around **December 4, 2025**.
