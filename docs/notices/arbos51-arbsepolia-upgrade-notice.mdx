On Monday, December 1, 2025 at 17:00 UTC, ArbOS 51 will activate on the Arbitrum Sepolia chain.

:::warning Action required

Arbitrum Sepolia node operators **must upgrade** to Nitro **`v3.9.3`** ahead of this activation to continue syncing the chain.

- **Docker image:** `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.9.3-8bc5554`
- **Release notes:** https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3

:::

### **Context**

ArbOS 51 is a follow-up to ArbOS 50 and includes the activation for multidimensional-pricing instrumentation. ArbOS 50 was previously activated on Sepolia, but the Gas Target & Pricing Framework changes remained disabled pending a fix. ArbOS 51 now completes that work.

Upstream governance items (ArbOS 50 + Gas Target & Pricing Framework) are being bundled into a single on-chain vote. Both components have passed Snapshot temperature checks, with the Tally vote expected to open on or around **December 4, 2025**.
