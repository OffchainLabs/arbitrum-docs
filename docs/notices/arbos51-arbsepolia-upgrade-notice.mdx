## Context

[ArbOS 51 "Dia"](docs/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51.mdx) builds upon [ArbOS 40 "Callisto"](docs/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos40.mdx) with support for the relevant EVM changes that are a part of Ethereum's [Fusaka upgrade](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/fusaka/), as well as additional improvements to the gas pricing algorithm, a change to the min L2 base fee, `MaxTxGasLimit` allowing full block utilization, changes to instrument Nitro’s State Transition Function (STF) to price gas based on specific resource usage, native token mint/burn capabilities, and a few bug fixes.
