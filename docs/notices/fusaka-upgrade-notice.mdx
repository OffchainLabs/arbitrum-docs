<VanillaAdmonition type="note">

Arbitrum chain operators must ensure that their nodes are properly configured before or shortly after the parent chain upgrades to Fusaka or the child chain upgrades to [ArbOS 50](docs/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos50.mdx).

</VanillaAdmonition>

This document explains what you need to do if you operate a chain that settles on a Fusaka-enabled parent chain. This includes actions for Arbitrum Orbit chains as well as actions for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators.

## What's included in Fusaka

The Fusaka upgrade introduces several breaking changes. Review [EIP-7607](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7607) for detailed information about the EIPs included in the Fusaka hard fork.

## Important dates

The following dates are relevant for Arbitrum chain operators.

Arbitrum chain operators must ensure that their nodes are properly configured before or shortly after the parent chain upgrades to Fusaka or the child chain upgrades to [ArbOS 50](docs/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos50.mdx).

## For node operators

Outlined below are different types of Arbitrum chains, along with node software required for operators of chains in those configurations.

### How to ensure your node has access to all historical blob data

#### If you run a Nitro node and use an external L1 Ethereum beacon chain RPC:

Confirm that your external L1 beacon chain RPC provider has configured their L1 beacon chain node to subscribe to all subnets before the Ethereum Fusaka hard fork and have all historical blob data to ensure your Nitro node can sync from periods beyond the blob retention period (or that your RPC provider has backfilled the blob data properly).

#### If you run a Nitro node and operate your own L1 Ethereum beacon chain node:

Ensure that your consensus layer client & Nitro node is configured as per the table below.

| Client        | Compatible with Nitro | Required Nitro Flag                                                 | Required Beacon Node Flag                     |
