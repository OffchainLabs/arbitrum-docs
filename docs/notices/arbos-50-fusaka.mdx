Learn how to prepare for the Fusaka upgrade

This is for Arbitrum chain owners and node operators deriving from an L1 chain which is due to activate Fusaka (including Ethereum Mainnet and Sepolia).

<VanillaAdmonition type="warning">

All of the tasks below must be performed before Fusaka activates on L1.

Blob note

</VanillaAdmonition>

### For chains that haven't yet upgraded to use Arbitrum BoLD

While ArbOS 50 Dia will be compatible with both `nitro-contracts 3.x` and [nitro-contracts 2.1.3](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.3), only chains that have Arbitrum BoLD enabled can use `nitro-contracts 3.x`. This requirement means that if your chain hasn't yet upgraded to use BoLD, only use [nitro-contracts 2.1.3](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.3) for your ArbOS 50 Dia upgrade.
