# Interactive Diagram Navigation Test

This page demonstrates the click-through diagram navigation system. Click on any **blue node** to navigate to detailed views.

## Arbitrum Architecture Overview

Click on the blue nodes below to explore different components of the Arbitrum system:

<MermaidReactFlow diagramFile="/diagrams/overview.mmd" height="400px" showControls={true} />

## How to Use

1. **Click on blue nodes** - These are clickable and will load a new diagram
2. **Gray nodes** - These are informational only and not clickable
3. **Back button** - Appears in the top-left when you navigate to a new diagram
4. **Controls** - Use the zoom/pan controls in the bottom-left to navigate the diagram

## Navigation Flow Example

Starting from the overview diagram above, try this navigation path:

1. Click on **"Ethereum L1"** → Shows Layer 1 components
2. Click on **"Inbox Contract"** → Shows inbox message flow details
3. Click **"Back"** button → Returns to Ethereum L1 view
4. Click **"Back"** again → Returns to overview

## Features

- **Theme-aware**: Diagrams adapt to light/dark mode
- **Keyboard accessible**: Use Tab to focus nodes, Enter/Space to navigate
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **History-based navigation**: Back button follows your navigation path

## Try Different Paths

You can also try:

- Overview → **Arbitrum L2** → explore Layer 2 components
- Ethereum Details → **Rollup Contract** (if implemented)

The navigation is non-linear - you can explore in any order and always return using the back button.
