A precompile is a predefined smart contract with a special address that provides specific functionality executed natively by the Arbitrum client, rather than at the EVM bytecode level. Precompiles are used to introduce functions that would be computationally expensive if run in EVM bytecode, or to facilitate interactions between the parent and child chains. Arbitrum supports all Ethereum precompiles and also provides additional precompiles specific to Arbitrum chains, which can be called from smart contracts like regular Solidity functions[(1)](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/overview).
