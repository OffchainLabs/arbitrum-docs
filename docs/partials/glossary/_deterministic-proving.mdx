If challenged, state transitions are replayable and verified onchain.

To achieve this, Arbitrum compiles the State Transition Function (STF) into different formats:

- **Execution mode**: Uses Go's native compiler for high-performance execution on <a data-quicklook-from="validator">validator</a> nodes.

- **Proving mode**: Compiles to WebAssembly (<a data-quicklook-from="wasm">WASM</a>), which transforms into WebAssembly for Arbitrum Virtual Machine (WAVM) for fraud-proof verification.
