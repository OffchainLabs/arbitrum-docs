A particular [Custom gateway](/intro/glossary#custom-gateway) via which a parent chain token contract can be registered to a token contract deployed to a child chain. A useful alternative to the [`StandardERC20` gateway](/intro/glossary#standarderc20-gateway) for projects that wish to control the address of their child chain token contract, maintain the child chain token contract upgradability, and for various other use-cases.
