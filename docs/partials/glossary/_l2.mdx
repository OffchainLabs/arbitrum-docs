An L2, or Layer 2, is a trustless scaling solution built on top of Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) base protocol. Arbitrum is a Layer 2 protocol that increases scalability and reduces the cost of transactions on Ethereum's Layer 1 without introducing additional trust assumptions. It does that by executing some computation offchain and batch-posting transactions on the underlying Layer 1.
