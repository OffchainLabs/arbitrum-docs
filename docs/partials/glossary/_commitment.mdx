In the context of Arbitrum, commitments represents a part of a chain's history. Commitments are used during the fraud proof dispute resolution process, where validators create a Merkle commitment to the history between two assertions. This allows them to efficiently narrow down disagreements about the chain state by using Merkle proofs to specific blocks or states within that range[(1)](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-technical-deep-dive).
