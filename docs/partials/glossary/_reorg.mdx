A situation in which transactions on a chain that were at some point considered accepted then get rejected. In the context of an Arbitrum chain, once transactions are posted in the chain's [Sequencer Inbox](/intro/glossary#sequencer-inbox), the only way the chain can experience a reorg is if its [Underlying Chain](/intro/glossary#underlying-chain) itself reorgs. Of note, [Fraud proofs](/intro/glossary#fraud-proof) do not cause reorgs.
