RaaS (Rollup as a Service) is a platform that provides the necessary infrastructure and tools to deploy and operate blockchain Rollups, eliminating the need for teams to build the underlying technical infrastructure themselves. It typically includes pre-built Rollup software, node hosting, data availability solutions, and monitoring tools, allowing developers to focus on their application logic rather than the complex technical implementation of Rollup technology.
