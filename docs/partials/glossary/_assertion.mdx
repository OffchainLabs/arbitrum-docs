A bonded claim made by an Arbitrum [Validator](/intro/glossary#validator) representing a claim about an Arbitrum chain's state. An [Assertion](/intro/glossary#assertion) may, e.g., propose a new assertion, or may be a step in a [Challenge](/intro/glossary#challenge).

Assertions can have different states:

- **Proposed**: When a validator submits an assertion
- **Challenged**: If another validator disputes the assertion, an interactive fraud-proof initiates.
- **Confirmed**: An assertion becomes final if no one challenges it within the dispute window (6.4 days).
