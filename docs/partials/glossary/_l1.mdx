L1, or Layer 1, refers to the underlying blockchain responsible for maintaining the integrity of the distributed ledger. In the context of Arbitrum One and Nova, L1 is the main Ethereum blockchain (Mainnet), and Arbitrum operates as a Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of this base layer. However, any EVM-compatible blockchain can be an L1 to an Arbitrum chain.
