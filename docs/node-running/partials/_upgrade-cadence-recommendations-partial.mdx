:::info How often should I be upgrading my ArbOS version?
It is strongly recommended to keep your Nitro's node software up-to-date as best you can to ensure you are benefting from the latest improvements to the Arbitrum technology stack. ArbOS version bumps are especially important because these upgrades change how Arbitrum nodes produce and validate assertions on a rollup's state.
