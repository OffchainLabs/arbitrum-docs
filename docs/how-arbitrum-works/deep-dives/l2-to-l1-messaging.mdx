:::tip Looking for implementation guides?

This document explains the protocol-level concepts of child-to-parent messaging. For practical, step-by-step instructions on implementing withdrawals and messaging, see [How to bridge to parent chain from child chain](/build-decentralized-apps/how-to-bridge-to-parent-chain.mdx).

<a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a>'s <a data-quicklook-from="outbox">outbox</a> system
allows for arbitrary <a data-quicklook-from="child-chain">child chain</a> to <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">
  parent chain
</a> contract calls, i.e., messages initiated from the child chain, which eventually resolve in
execution on the parent chain. Child-to-parent chain messages (aka "outgoing" messages) bear some
things in common with Arbitrum's [parent chain to child chain
messages](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx), which are "in reverse" though with
differences, which we'll explore in this section.

## Protocol flow

Messages from child to parent are included in Arbitrum's Rollup state and finalized through the Rollup Protocol. The process follows these steps:

1. **Message creation on child chain**:
   - To initiate a child-to-parent chain message, a user or contract calls the `sendTxToL1` method on the `ArbSys` precompile.
2. **Message inclusion in an <a data-quicklook-from="assertion">assertion</a>**:
   - The message is batched with other transactions and included in a Rollup assertion.
   - Assertions are submitted to the Rollup contract on the parent chain and enter the dispute window (~one week).
3. **Assertion confirmation**:
   - If the assertion remains unchallenged after the dispute window, the Rollup contract finalizes the assertion.
   - The assertion's Merkle root gets posted to the outbox contract on the parent chain.
4. **Execution on the parent chain**:
   - Once the assertion is confirmed, anyone can execute the message on the parent chain by proving its inclusion.
   - Execution is possible using `Outbox.executeTransaction`, which takes a Merkle proof proving the message exists in the finalized assertion.

## Sending and executing messages

Child-to-parent messages are sent via the `ArbSys` precompile's `sendTxToL1` method. After the ~7 day challenge period, messages can be executed on the parent chain using the `Outbox.executeTransaction` method with a Merkle proof obtained from the `NodeInterface` contract.

For step-by-step implementation instructions, see [How to bridge to parent chain](/build-decentralized-apps/how-to-bridge-to-parent-chain.mdx).

## Protocol design details

### Constant overhead for node confirmation

- Calling `confirmNode` on the Rollup contract has constant gas overhead, regardless of the number of messages in the assertion.
- This confirmation ensures malicious actors cannot grief the network by submitting assertions with many outgoing messages.

### Why child to parent chain messages require manual execution

Unlike [retryable tickets](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/l1-to-l2-messaging.mdx), which can execute automatically with pre-funded gas, child-to-parent chain message must undergo manual execution because Ethereum (parent chain) does not support scheduled execution.

However, applications can implement execution markets that allow third parties to execute messages for a fee.

### Persistence and expiry

- **Child-to-parent chain messages**: - Persist indefinitely on the parent chain once included in the outbox.

## Parent-to-child chain message lifecycle

Each message progresses through three primary states:
| Stage | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Posted on child chain | The message is sent via `ArbSys.sendTxToL1`. |
| Waiting for finalization | The assertion containing the message is in the <a data-quicklook-from="challenge-period">challenge period</a> (~6.4 days) |
| Confirmed and executable on the parent chain | If no <a data-quicklook-from="fraud-proof">fraud proof</a> is submitted, the assertion is confirmed, and the message is available for execution in the outbox. |

## Asset withdrawals

### ETH withdrawals

The `ArbSys` precompile provides a `withdrawEth` convenience method for withdrawing ETH from the child chain. This method burns the ETH on the child chain and creates a child-to-parent message. Like all child-to-parent messages, it requires execution on the parent chain after the challenge period via `Outbox.executeTransaction`.

For implementation details, see [Withdrawing ETH](/build-decentralized-apps/how-to-bridge-to-parent-chain.mdx#withdrawing-eth).

### ERC-20 token withdrawals

Token withdrawals use Arbitrum's canonical bridge architecture, detailed in the [Token bridging overview](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/token-bridging.mdx). The process flows through the `L2GatewayRouter` to the appropriate gateway contract (`L2ArbitrumGateway`), which burns the child chain tokens and creates a message to the parent chain gateway. After the challenge period, the message can be executed on the parent chain to release tokens from escrow.

For implementation details, see [Withdrawing ERC-20 tokens](/build-decentralized-apps/how-to-bridge-to-parent-chain.mdx#withdrawing-erc-20-tokens).
