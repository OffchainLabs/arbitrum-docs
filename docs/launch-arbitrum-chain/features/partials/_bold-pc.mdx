## Pros

- **Improved Security**: Mitigates delay attacks and ensures only valid states are confirmed, with high bonds (e.g., millions in USD equivalent) deterring malice while allowing trustless defense.
- **Permissionless Decentralization**: Anyone can validate via bonds, reducing reliance on centralized entities and enabling community participation through pools.
- **Bounded Delays**: Caps withdrawal delays at ~12.8 days during disputes, providing predictability.
- **Incentives**: Includes bounties (1% of confiscated bonds) and reimbursements for honest defenders, plus optional chain-specific rewards.

## Cons

- **High Economic Barriers**: Large bonds (e.g., 3600 `ETH` for assertions) may limit small-scale participation without pools, and disputes impose opportunity costs on users (e.g., ~$3.27M USD/week for Arbitrum One's TVL).
- **Upgrade Disruptions**: Enabling BoLD delays pending withdrawals and requires careful overflow handling during the upgrade.
- **Complexity**: Adds operational needs for proposers and parameter tuning (e.g., bond sizes, resource ratios) to maintain security.
