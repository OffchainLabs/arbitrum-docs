## Pros

- Revenue generation for chain owners. Proceeds can fund ecosystems or burn tokens.
- Reduces spam/congestion from latency races; fairer, predictable MEV access for searchers.
- Maintains security (no harmful MEV increase) and fast blocks; open auctions prevent monopolies.

## Cons

- Adds ~200ms delay to non-express user transactions (~450ms average response), potentially impacting UX.
- Setup/maintenance costs (e.g., auctioneer servers, Redis) may exceed revenue on low-MEV chains.
- No guaranteed revenue; ineffective without MEV activity. Minor risks like bid limits for DDoS mitigation.
