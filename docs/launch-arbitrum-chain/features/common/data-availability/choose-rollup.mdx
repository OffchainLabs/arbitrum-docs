Choosing a rollup refers to selecting the Arbitrum Rollup protocol for a chain's data availability (DA) mechanism. This choice is relevant when deploying custom chains or configuring Arbitrum-based systems.

The rollup option prioritizes security and decentralization over cost efficiency. It's ideal for applications needing Ethereum's ironclad guarantees, such as high-value DeFi protocols or where users demand minimal trust in third parties. In contrast, opting out of Rollup (e.g., for AnyTrust) is better for high-throughput, low-cost use cases like gaming or social apps, where slight trade-offs in trust are acceptable for better performance.

This flexibility allows developers to tailor chains to specific needs while building on Arbitrum's optimistic execution framework.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Availability (DA) in Rollups**: DA ensures that all transaction data is publicly accessible for verification, fraud proofs, and security. In optimistic rollups like Arbitrum, this is critical to allow challengers to dispute invalid state transitions.
- **Arbitrum Rollup Mode**:
  - All batch transaction data is posted directly to the parent chain (Ethereum L1) as calldata or blobs.
  - This inherits Ethereum's full security and decentralization, with no additional trust assumptions—data is always available on-chain for anyone to access and verify.
  - Example: Arbitrum One operates in this mode.
