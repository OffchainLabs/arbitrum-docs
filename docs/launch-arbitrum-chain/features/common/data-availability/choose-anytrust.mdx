Choosing AnyTrust mode refers to selecting the AnyTrust protocol as the data availability (DA) mechanism for a chain, such as when deploying custom chains. AnyTrust is an alternative to the pure Rollup mode, prioritizing cost efficiency and performance over maximum decentralization.

Opting for AnyTrust means configuring your Arbitrum-based chain to use this DA approach for reduced operational costs and better scalability, while accepting a slight trade-off in trust-minimization compared to posting all data directly to <a data-quicklook-from="l1">L1</a> (as in Rollup mode).

It's ideal for use cases where ultra-low fees are a priority over Ethereum's full security guarantees, such as consumer apps or high-frequency trading platforms. Developers can set up and configure a DAC via Arbitrum's tools, including defining the committee size and keyset threshold. This flexibility allows tailoring to specific needs within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and it's compatible with other Arbitrum chain features like custom gas tokens or third-party DA integrations.

## Key concepts

- **Data Availability (DA) in Arbitrum**: DA ensures <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> data is accessible for verification, fraud proofs, and maintaining security in optimistic Rollups. Without reliable DA, users couldn't independently validate the chain's state.
- **AnyTrust mode**:
  - Transaction data is initially submitted off-chain to a permissioned group of nodes called the Data Availability Committee (DAC), typically consisting of around 20 members (though configurable).
  - The DAC stores the data and signs a <a data-quicklook-from="data-availability-certificate">Data Availability Certificate</a> (DACert), which posts to the <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a>. Full data is not posted onchain unless requested (e.g., during a <a data-quicklook-from="challenge">challenge</a>).
  - Security relies on a "keyset" where at least two honest members are assumed to prevent data withholding—far milder than centralized assumptions but not fully <a data-quicklook-from="trustless">trustless</a> like Rollup mode.

This option reflects the growing trend toward modular <a data-quicklook-from="blockchain">blockchain</a> architectures, where DA handling is separate to scale ecosystems like Arbitrum without compromising core security. For implementation, refer to the docs or your RaaS; a [list of RaaSes is on the Third-party providers page](/launch-arbitrum-chain/06-third-party-integrations/02-third-party-providers.md#rollup-as-a-service-raas-providers).

## How to configure

To configure AnyTrust this is a pre-deployment decision. You must choose whether or not you will be leveraging AnyTrust prior to deploying your chain.

When calling the `prepareChainConfig` function, it will create a `chainConfig` structure. It sets the appropriate default values for most of the parameters, which allows you to override any of the defaults.

Below is an example of how to use `prepareChainConfig` to set the chain configuration for an AnyTrust chain (`chainId` and `InitialChainOwner` are not set by default):

```typescript
import { prepareChainConfig } from '@arbitrum/chain-sdk';

const chainConfig = prepareChainConfig({
  chainId: 123_456,
  arbitrum: {
    InitialChainOwner: 0x123...890,
    // The following parameter determines whether this is an AnyTrust chain
    // AnyTrust = true, Rollup = false
    DataAvailabilityCommittee: true,
  },
});
```
