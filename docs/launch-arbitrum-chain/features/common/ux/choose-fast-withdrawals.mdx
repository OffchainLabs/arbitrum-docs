Enabling fast withdrawals refers to configuring the chain to use a fast confirmation mechanism that allows transactions and state assertions to achieve finality much quicker than the standard multi-day challenge period in optimistic rollups. This is achieved by routing assertions through a permissioned committee of validators (often overlapping with the Data Availability Committee or DAC in AnyTrust mode) that unanimously confirms them via a multisig wallet, bypassing the full fraud-proof window. As a result, users can withdraw assets or access finalized states in as little as 15 minutes for L2 chains or 15 seconds for L3 chains, significantly enhancing user experience by reducing wait times and enabling faster cross-chain interactions.

Enabling this feature shifts the chain from relying solely on time-based fraud proofs to a committee-driven confirmation process, where validators (recommended to be at least three for reduced trust risks) must agree unanimously. It's primarily recommended for AnyTrust chains, as it leverages the existing DAC trust model without adding new assumptions—ideally, DAC members run the validators.

For pure Rollup chains, enabling it effectively introduces a committee trust layer, making it less "trust-minimized" than standard mode. Once enabled, the chain processes a potential backlog of unconfirmed assertions before operating at full speed, and confirmations may slightly delay under high load (e.g., >1 Mgas/s throughput), but security remains intact.

## Key Concepts

- **Standard Withdrawal Process**: In optimistic rollups like Arbitrum, assertions about the chain's state (e.g., transaction batches) are posted to the parent chain (e.g., Ethereum or Arbitrum One) and remain challengeable for a configurable period (default ~6.4-7 days) to allow fraud proofs. Unchallenged assertions confirm, enabling secure withdrawals, but this delays user access to funds.
- **Fast Withdrawals Mechanism**: When enabled, a committee (e.g., an n/n multisig Safe wallet) of validators processes and unanimously signs assertions at a set frequency. This provides immediate confirmation, with finality tied to the parent chain's block times rather than the full challenge period. For example, L2 chains on Ethereum can confirm in ~15 minutes (above Ethereum's ~12.8-minute finality), while L3 chains on Arbitrum One can leverage "soft finality" (~250ms sequencer confirmations) for near-instant speeds.
- **Related Parameters**: Often paired with adjusting the `minimumAssertionPeriod` (e.g., to 1 block for frequent assertions) and node flags to control posting intervals.

## Compatibility

- **DA Modes**: Optimized for AnyTrust (leverages DAC); possible but not recommended for Rollup or Alt-DA, as it adds trust assumptions.
- **Validation**: Works with BoLD (permissionless) or pre-BoLD (permissioned), but the committee must be allowlisted.
- **Gas Tokens**: No restrictions; compatible with native `ETH` or custom `ERC-20`s.
- **Parent Chain**: Frequency must exceed the parent's finality time (e.g., >12.8 minutes for Ethereum L2s).

## Pros

- Dramatically faster finality (15s-15m vs. days), improving UX for withdrawals and dApps.
- Configurable frequency for tailored performance.
- No new trust if validators are DAC members in AnyTrust.

## Cons

- Introduces reliance on a unanimous committee, potentially increasing trust assumptions (mitigated with ≥3 members).
- Minor delays possible under high load; initial backlog post-enable.
- Not ideal for pure Rollups; requires upgrades and careful parent-chain alignment.

## Impact on User Experience

From a UX perspective, enabling fast withdrawals transforms slow, multi-day processes into near-real-time ones, making the chain feel more responsive. Users get quicker access to withdrawn funds (e.g., 15 minutes vs. 6.4 days), reducing frustration and capital lockup. dApps benefit from faster cross-chain state reads, enabling seamless interactions like oracle updates or multi-chain DeFi. However, it assumes users trust the committee (e.g., for high-value transfers), and any load-based delays could still impact predictability. Overall, it's ideal for consumer-facing apps like gaming or social, where speed is key.

## Examples

- **AnyTrust L2 Chain**: Configure for 15-minute withdrawals on Ethereum, using DAC members as validators for trust alignment.
- **L3 on Arbitrum One**: Set to 15 seconds using soft finality, suitable for high-throughput gaming appchains.

## How to configure

1. **Upgrade Contracts and Nodes**: Ensure nitro-contracts v2.1.0+ (update `RollupAdminLogic` and `RollupUserLogic`) and node software to nitro v3.1.2+. Use the Orbit versioner script to check and upgrade.
2. **Run Configuration Scripts**: Use the Orbit SDK (e.g., setup-fast-withdrawal example) or Orbit actions repo (e.g., fast-confirm script with Foundry's cast CLI) to create a Safe multisig for the committee, add validators to the allowlist, set the Safe as the `anytrustFastConfirmer`, and optionally adjust `minimumAssertionPeriod` (defaults to 75 blocks ~15 minutes, measured in the first non-Arbitrum ancestor chain's blocks).
3. **Configure Nodes**:
   - Batch Poster: Set `--node.batch-poster.max-delay` to match the assertion period (e.g., 15m).
   - Validators (BoLD mode): Enable `--node.bold.enable-fast-confirmation=true` and set `--node.bold.assertion-posting-interval` to the period.
   - Validators (pre-BoLD): Similar flags like `--node.staker.enable-fast-confirmation=true`.

This feature aligns with Arbitrum's focus on scalable, user-friendly chains while maintaining core security. For setup, consult the official docs, or your RaaS; a [list of RaaSes is on the Third-party providers page](/launch-arbitrum-chain/third-party-integrations/third-party-providers.mdx#rollup-as-a-service-raas-providers).
