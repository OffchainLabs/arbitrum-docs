Configuring the delayed inbox finality refers to adjusting sequencer node flags to control the timing and dependencies for when transactions (e.g., cross-chain messages or deposits) sent through the Delayed Inbox achieve finality on the child chain. The Delayed Inbox is a fallback mechanism for parent-to-child communications that bypasses the sequencer for direct inclusion, ensuring censorship resistance.

By default, finality for these transactions relies on layer-1 (L1) Ethereum block confirmations (typically tens of minutes). Configuration allows shifting to faster L2-based finality or reducing confirmation waits, trading speed for potential re-org risks. This reduction is an advanced sequencer-level setting, not a deployment-time parameter, and is primarily used to optimize bridging speed for use cases like high-frequency DeFi or gaming.

## Key concepts

- **Delayed Inbox**: A contract on the parent chain where users can submit transactions (e.g., retryable tickets for token bridges or direct calls) to be force-included on the child chain if the sequencer delays them. These are held until the sequencer releases them based on parent chain progress.
- **Finality**: The point at which a Delayed Inbox transaction is irreversibly executable on the child chain. By default, this depends on L1 finality (e.g., Ethereum blocks confirming a batch from Arbitrum One or a Data Availability Certificate/DACert from Nova), taking ~10-60 minutes.
- **L2 vs. L1 Finality**: L3 chains can be configured to rely on the parent L2's quicker "soft finality" (~1-15 minutes) instead of waiting for deeper L1 confirmations, or to reduce L2 block waits for even faster processing.
- **Relevant Flags**:
  - `--node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false`: Disables L1 dependency, using only L2 finality.
  - `--node.delayed-sequencer.finalize-distance=1`: Sets the number of L2 block confirmations needed (default is higher; 1 enables ~1-minute finality).

## What It Means to Configure Delayed Inbox Finality

This configuration sets up the sequencer to release Delayed Inbox messages earlier, prioritizing speed over maximum security. For instance, in a default setup, a deposit from Ethereum to an L3 (via L2 settlement) waits for L1 to finalize the L2's batch posting. Enabling L2-only finality skips this, releasing after L2 confirmations (e.g., when a DACert posts on Nova). Further reducing the finalize-distance minimizes L2 waits, allowing near-instant execution but exposing the chain to parent re-orgs if unconfirmed blocks revert. It's ideal for low-latency apps but requires monitoring for re-org events.

:::note

This affects only incoming (parent-to-child) Delayed Inbox flows; outgoing (child-to-parent) finality uses separate mechanisms, such as DAC in AnyTrust mode, for ~15-minute confirmations.

### Configuration Process:

- **Prepare the Sequencer Node**: When running your Orbit chain's sequencer (e.g., via Docker or local build from Nitro source), add the flags to the startup command. Example for a Dockerized sequencer:
  `docker run --rm -it -p 8547:8547 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.7.2 --chain.id=12345 --node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false --node.delayed-sequencer.finalize-distance=1`
- Replace with your chain's parameters (e.g., parent chain URL).
- **Test and Deploy**: Verify in a devnet by submitting a Delayed Inbox transaction (e.g., via a token bridge) and monitoring release timing in logs. For production, ensure validators are updated to match the new behavior.
- **Monitor**: Use tools like chain explorers or sequencer logs to track finality times and re-org incidents.

## How It Differs from Default

- **Default (L1-Dependent)**: Relies on Ethereum L1 finality for batches/DACerts, ensuring maximum security but slower deposits (~tens of minutes).
- **Configured (L2-Only with Low Distance)**: Shifts to L2 soft finality and minimal confirmations, achieving ~1-minute deposits but introducing re-org risks if the parent L2 reverts unconfirmed blocks.

## Pros

- Significantly faster cross-chain deposits (e.g., 1 minute vs. tens), enhancing UX for bridging and dApps.
- Flexible for L3 setups settling to L2, optimizing for the parent chain's quicker confirmations.

## Cons

- Increases re-org vulnerability on the child chain if the parent experiences instability in unconfirmed blocks.
- Not suitable for high-security applications; requires careful monitoring and may complicate fraud proofs if mismatches occur.

## Compatibility

- Primarily for Orbit L3 chains settling to Arbitrum One or Nova; not directly applicable to L2s settling to Ethereum.
- Compatible with all DA modes (Rollup, AnyTrust, Alt-DA) and gas tokens (native `ETH` or custom), as it focuses on sequencer logic.
- Integrates with BoLD or permissioned validation; for AnyTrust, pairs well with DAC for symmetric fast incoming/outgoing flows.

## Examples

- **Default L1 Finality**: A token deposit from Ethereum to an L3 (settling to Arbitrum One) waits for L1 to confirm the L2 batch, finalizing in ~10-30 minutes.
- **Fast L2 Finality**: For an L3 settling to Arbitrum Nova, configure with `--node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false` `--node.delayed-sequencer.finalize-distance=1`. A bridge deposit is released after 1 L2 block (~1 minute), but may be reorg'd if Nova reverts.
- **DACert-Optimized**: On Nova settlement with default flags, finality ties to DACert posting (~tens of minutes); configuring low-distance speeds reduces this to ~1 minute for gaming apps needing quick asset transfers.

This feature underscores Arbitrum's modularity for performance tuning while inheriting parent security. For implementation, refer to the latest Nitro sequencer docs or your RaaS; a [list of RaaSes is on the Third-party providers page](/launch-arbitrum-chain/06-third-party-integrations/02-third-party-providers.md#rollup-as-a-service-raas-providers).
