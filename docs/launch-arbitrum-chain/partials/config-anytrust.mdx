## Pros of using AnyTrust

- **Ultra-low transaction fees**: By offloading data availability to a Data Availability Committee (DAC) instead of posting all transactions data directly to Ethereum L1, AnyTrust significantly reduces costs, and making micro-transactions viable.
- **Higher throughput and speed**: Supports a much larger volume of transactions per second compared to traditional rollups, ideal for high-frequency applications.
- **Faster withdrawals**: Withdrawals to Ethereum can occur immediately if vouched for by the DAC, avoiding the typical seven day challenge period.
- **Minimal trust assumptions with strong feedback**: Requires only a small number of honest DAC members for normal operation, which is less trust-intensive. If the DAC fails, it automatically falls back to rollup mode, posting data to Ethereum for security.
- **Customization**: Enables flexible configurations like custom gas tokens, governance, and execution logic while inherting low-cost benefits.
- **Ideal for specific use cases**: Best for high-volume, low-value applications such as Web3 gaming, decentralization social media, NFT platforms, and micro-payment systems where cost efficiency outweighs maximum decentralization.

## Cons of using AnyTrust

- **Introduced trust assumptions**: Relies on the DAC's honesty and availability, which adds a layer of trust not present in full trustless rollups, this could be a risk if committee members collude or fail.
- **Reduced decentralization and security guarantees**: Lacks the full trustlessness, permissionlessness, and censorship resistance of rollups, as not all data is posted to Ethereum by default. This makes it less suitable for high-value DeFi or applications requiring Ethereum-level security.
- **Potential for fallback mode issues**: If the DAC quorum isn't met, the chain reverts to rollup mode, which could increase costs temporarily and introduces delays similar to standard rollups.
- **Liquidity and adoption changes**: May face lower liquidity or ecosystem integration compared to rollup-based chains like Arbitrum One, potentially limiting interoperability for certain dApps.
- **Not optimal for all use cases**: For applications handling significant financial value or needing maximum security, the trade-offs in decentralization could outweigh the benefits.
