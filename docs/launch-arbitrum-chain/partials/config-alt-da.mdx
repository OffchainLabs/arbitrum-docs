## Benefits of Using Alternative Data Availability Sources in Arbitrum (Orbit) Chains

Arbitrum Orbit enables the deployment of customizable Layer 2 (L2) or Layer 3 (L3) chains, and alternative data availability (DA) sources refer to third-party DA layers (e.g., Celestia, EigenDA, Avail, NEAR DA) used instead of Ethereum (full L2 mode) or the built-in AnyTrust (DAC-based). This modular approach, shifts DA off Ethereum for cost optimization while maintaining settlement on Ethereum or Arbitrum chains. Key benefits include:

- **Drastically reduced costs**: Alternative DA layers can lower transaction fees by 90% or more compared to Ethereum DA, as data posting eliminates the need for expensive L1 calldata or blobs. For instance, integrations like Celestia or EigenDA minimize DA expenses, making high-volume apps viable without prohibitive gas costs.
- **Enhanced scalability and throughput**: By offloading DA to specialized layers, chains achieve higher TPS and sub-second block times, making them ideal for demanding use cases such as gaming, AI, or social platforms. This offloading decouples scaling from Ethereum's constraints, enabling dedicated resources.
- **Greater flexibility and customization**: Developers can tailor DA to meet project-specific needs, such as enhancing privacy through offchain storage or integrating with innovative providers. Arbitrum's Nitro stack supports seamless swaps between DA options, fostering sovereignty without full Ethereum dependency.
- **Improved performance for specific use cases**: Suited for non-financial apps (e.g., NFTs, social) where cost and speed outweigh maximal security. Features like fallback to full L2 mode in disputes ensure reliability, while alt DA enables low-fee environments for user growth.
- **Innovation and ecosystem integration**: Supports emerging DA solutions, such as EigenLayer for restaking or Celestia for modular design, potentially unlocking new economic models (e.g., shared security) and broader interoperability.

### Decisions Regarding Alternative Data Availability Sources

Choosing alt-DA is often set at deployment and can be challenging to change, so use the Arbitrum (Orbit) SDK for testing. Decisions focus on aligning with project goals, such as cost vs. security, with RaaS providers (e.g., Zeeve, Chaindrop) simplifying integration. The table below outlines key areas:

| Decision Area                   | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DA Provider Selection**       | Evaluate options such as Celestia (modular and low-cost), EigenDA (restaking for security), Avail (high throughput), NEAR DA (efficient for L2s/L3s), or others integrated via Arbitrum (Orbit) SDK (e.g., as per official documentation). Factor in compatibility with Nitro stack and project needs (e.g., data privacy or speed). | Celestia offers broad accessibility but may have higher latency; EigenDA enhances security via restaking but adds complexity. Poor choice can lead to integration issues or unexpected fees. |
| **Chain Mode**                  | Decide whether alt DA replaces Ethereum (full L2) or AnyTrust (DAC); alt DA creates an offchain DA setup with onchain settlement. Use for L3s settling to Arbitrum One/Nova.                                                                                                                                                         | Offchain DA reduces costs but introduces external trust risks (e.g., DA layer failure, data unavailability); compared to full L2's full trustlessness or AnyTrust's committee-based model.   |
| **Settlement and Integration**  | Choose settlement layer (Ethereum for max security, Arbitrum One for efficiency) and ensure compliance with the Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP). Integrate via RaaS for managed DA fallback mechanisms.                                                                                                                             | Ethereum settlement boosts security but increases costs; non-standard may require governance approval, risking delays.                                                                       |
| **Security vs. Cost Balance**   | Assess any trust assumptions - Alt-DA may rely on fewer nodes or external validators. Prioritize non-critical apps; include monitoring for DA health.                                                                                                                                                                                | Higher cost savings, but reduced decentralization and immutability. This approach is unsuitable for DeFi, where Ethereum DA is safer.                                                        |
| **Project Type and Use Case**   | Opt for alt-DA in gaming, AI, or social apps needing scalability; skip for financial services requiring high integrity. Test with the Arbitrum (Orbit) SDK for performance.                                                                                                                                                          | Benefits low-stakes apps but risks in high-value scenarios; adds operational overhead for DA management.                                                                                     |
| **Infrastructure and Provider** | Select RaaS for easy alt DA setup, including custom configs and monitoringâ€”Self-host for full control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Managed providers speed up deployment but add fees; self-hosting requires expertise in data integration.                                                                                     |
| **When to use or skip**         | Use for cost-driven, scalable projects; skip if maximum security is needed (stick with Ethereum DA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Great for innovation, but potential risks, such as downtime, may exist; evolving support may introduce better hybrid options in the future.                                                  |
