### Benefits of Using Alternative Data Availability Sources in Arbitrum Orbit Chains

Arbitrum Orbit enables the deployment of customizable Layer 2 (L2) or Layer 3 (L3) chains, and alternative data availability (DA) sources refer to third-party DA layers (e.g., Celestia, EigenDA, Avail, NEAR DA) used instead of Ethereum (rollup mode) or the built-in AnyTrust (DAC-based). This modular approach, expanded in the Arbitrum Orbit stack as of July 2025, shifts DA off Ethereum for cost optimization while maintaining settlement on Ethereum or Arbitrum chains. Key benefits include:

- **Drastically Reduced Costs**: Alternative DA layers can lower transaction fees by 90% or more compared to Ethereum DA, as data posting avoids expensive L1 calldata or blobs. For instance, integrations like Celestia or EigenDA minimize DA expenses, making high-volume apps viable without prohibitive gas costs.
- **Enhanced Scalability and Throughput**: By offloading DA to specialized layers, chains achieve higher TPS (e.g., thousands per second) and sub-second block times, ideal for demanding use cases like gaming, AI, or social platforms. This decouples scaling from Ethereum's constraints, enabling dedicated resources.
- **Greater Flexibility and Customization**: Developers can tailor DA to project needs, such as privacy via off-chain storage or integration with innovative providers. Orbit's Nitro stack supports seamless swaps between DA options, fostering sovereignty without full Ethereum dependency.
- **Improved Performance for Specific Use Cases**: Suited for non-financial apps (e.g., NFTs, social) where cost and speed outweigh maximal security. Features like fallback to rollup mode in disputes ensure reliability, while alt DA enables low-fee environments for user growth.
- **Innovation and Ecosystem Integration**: Supports emerging DA solutions like EigenLayer for restaking or Celestia for modular design, potentially unlocking new economic models (e.g., shared security) and broader interoperability.

This setup transforms Orbit chains into "validium-like" hybrids, balancing Ethereum's security with alt DA efficiency, as seen in projects like AI-focused rollups or Anomaly L3.

### Decisions Regarding Alternative Data Availability Sources

Choosing alt DA is often set at deployment and can be challenging to change, so use the Orbit SDK for testing. Decisions focus on aligning with project goals like cost vs. security, with RaaS providers (e.g., Zeeve, Chaindrop) simplifying integration. The table below outlines key areas:

| Decision Area                               | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DA Provider Selection**                   | Evaluate options like Celestia (modular, low-cost), EigenDA (restaking for security), Avail (high-throughput), NEAR DA (efficient for rollups), or others integrated via Orbit (e.g., per official docs). Factor in compatibility with Nitro stack and project needs (e.g., data privacy or speed). | Celestia offers broad accessibility but may have higher latency; EigenDA enhances security via restaking but adds complexity. Poor choice can lead to integration issues or unexpected fees. |
| **Chain Mode (Validium Hybrid vs. Others)** | Decide if alt DA replaces Ethereum (rollup) or AnyTrust (DAC); alt DA creates a validium setup with off-chain DA and on-chain settlement. Use for L3s settling to Arbitrum One/Nova.                                                                                                                | Validium reduces costs but introduces external trust (e.g., DA layer failure risks data unavailability); vs. rollup's full trustlessness or AnyTrust's committee-based model.                |
| **Settlement and Integration**              | Choose settlement layer (Ethereum for max security, Arbitrum One for efficiency) and ensure compliance with Arbitrum Expansion Program. Integrate via RaaS for managed DA fallback mechanisms.                                                                                                      | Ethereum settlement boosts security but increases costs; non-standard may require governance approval, risking delays.                                                                       |
| **Security vs. Cost Balance**               | Assess trust assumptions: Alt DA may rely on fewer nodes or external validators. Prioritize for non-critical apps; include monitoring for DA health.                                                                                                                                                | Higher cost savings but reduced decentralization and immutability; unsuitable for DeFi where Ethereum DA is safer.                                                                           |
| **Project Type and Use Case**               | Opt for alt DA in gaming, AI, or social apps needing scalability; skip for financial services requiring high integrity. Test with SDK for performance.                                                                                                                                              | Benefits low-stakes apps but risks in high-value scenarios; adds operational overhead for DA management.                                                                                     |
| **Infrastructure and Provider**             | Select RaaS like Zeeve or Chaindrop for easy alt DA setup, including custom configs and monitoring. Self-host for full control.                                                                                                                                                                     | Managed providers speed deployment but add fees; self-hosting demands expertise in DA integrations.                                                                                          |
| **When to Use or Skip**                     | Use for cost-driven, scalable projects; skip if max security is needed (stick with Ethereum DA). Monitor for 2025 updates like new integrations.                                                                                                                                                    | Great for innovation but potential risks like DA downtime; evolving support may introduce better hybrids.                                                                                    |
