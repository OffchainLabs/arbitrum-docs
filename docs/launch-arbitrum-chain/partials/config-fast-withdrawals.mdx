### Benefits of Enabling Fast Withdrawals in Arbitrum Orbit Chains

Fast withdrawals in Arbitrum Orbit chains refer to a feature, primarily available in AnyTrust mode, that reduces the standard 7-day challenge period for asset exits (common in optimistic rollups) to approximately 15 minutes. This shorter period leverages the chain's Data Availability Committee (DAC) for quicker consensus, with integrations from bridges like Across enabling even sub-second user experiences. As of July 2025, this has been widely adopted in chains like ApeChain and Xai for enhanced performance. Key benefits include:

- **Dramatically Reduced Withdrawal Times**: Speeds up asset transfers from Orbit chains to parent layers (e.g., Arbitrum One or Ethereum) by up to 672x, from 7 days (10,080 minutes) to 15 minutes, enabling near-instant finality and aligning with user expectations for seamless interactions.
- **Improved Capital Efficiency and User Experience**: Users can access funds quickly, reducing lock-up periods and opportunity costs, which is ideal for high-volume apps like gaming or DeFi, where fast bridging minimizes friction and boosts retention.
- **Enhanced Interoperability and Liquidity**: Facilitates smoother cross-chain transfers, including between Orbit chains, lowering fees and enabling efficient relayer operations. Bridges like Across can provide 2-second intents, shifting risks to third parties for a better user experience.
- **Support for Emerging Use Cases**: Enables instant settlements in DeFi, RWAs, DePin, and gaming by removing hardware-intensive barriers, amplifying EVM compatibility, and cross-chain operations at reduced costs.
- **Cost Savings and Security Balance**: Combines with AnyTrust's low fees (30â€“150x cheaper than L1) while maintaining Ethereum's security via fallback mechanisms, making it suitable for throughput-intensive dApps like socialfi.
- **Developer and Ecosystem Advantages**: Simplifies deployment for entrepreneurs, supports custom gas tokens, and integrates with RaaS providers, fostering innovation without high infrastructure demands.

Examples include chains like Xai (gaming) and Nova (social points), where fast withdrawals have driven adoption by enabling quick, low-cost exits.

### Decisions Regarding Fast Withdrawals

Enabling fast withdrawals is tied to AnyTrust mode and DAC setup, which is often immutable after deployment, so test it via the Orbit SDK. Key decisions involve balancing speed with security, with RaaS like Zeeve or Caldera aiding implementation. The table below outlines the main areas:

| Decision Area                        | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                 | Trade-offs                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain Mode (AnyTrust vs. Rollup)** | Enable AnyTrust for fast withdrawals, using DAC for 15-minute confirmations; rollups stick to 7-day delays for full trustlessness.                 | AnyTrust offers speed/cost but adds trust assumption (e.g., 2/20 honest DAC members); rollups are more secure but slower/expensive. |
| **DAC Configuration**                | Set committee size (e.g., 20 members), honesty threshold (K=2), and members (reputable validators); ensure quorum for quick consensus.             | Larger DAC boosts security but increases coordination/costs; low K reduces trust needs but risks if colluded against.               |
| **Integration with Bridges**         | Utilize third-party solutions like Across for sub-second intents and L3-to-L3 support; plan for custom gas tokens (currently in audit as of 2025). | Enhances UX but relies on external relayers, shifting risks; no direct sibling chain transfers without bridges.                     |
| **Hardware and Infrastructure**      | Opt for lower specs (8-16GB RAM, 2-4 cores) vs. OP Stack's high demands; choose RaaS for managed DAC/fallback.                                     | Reduces barriers but may limit flexibility (e.g., new nodes can't join easily); self-hosting adds control but requires expertise.   |
| **Security vs. Speed Balance**       | Prioritize low-value transactions; include a fallback to Rollup for disputes.                                                                      | Faster exits risk fraud if DAC fails, but mitigated by Ethereum settlement; unsuitable for high-stakes DeFi.                        |
| **When to Enable or Skip**           | Enable for gaming/DeFi needing speed; skip for max security (use rollup). Test on devnet.                                                          | Adds operational risks, such as validator consensus failure; benefits outweigh the costs for cost-sensitive apps.                   |
