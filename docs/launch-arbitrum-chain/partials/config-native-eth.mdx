## Pros of using native `ETH`

- **Simplicity and familiarity for users**: Native `ETH` is the default gas token, making it easier for users already in the Ethereum ecosystem to interact with the chain without needing to acquire or bridge a new token. This reduces onboarding friction and leverages existing wallets and tools.
- **Enhanced security and trust**: By using `ETH`, the chain benefits from Ethereum's established security, decentralized, and market liquidity, which can build user confidence as `ETH` is a well-trusted asset.
- **Seamless interoperability**: Intergrates directly with the broader Ethereum ecosystem, including DeFi protocols, exchanges, and bridges, simplifying development and reducing the need for additional custom integrations.
- **Default configuration**: As the standard option for Arbitrum chains, it requires no additional setup for custom token configurations, speeding up deployment.

## Cons of using native `ETH`

- **Price volatility**: Gas fees are tied to `ETH`'s market price, which can fluctuate significantly, leading to unpredictable transaction costs for users.
- Limited customization: You cannot tailor tokenomics (e.g., inflation, rewards, or deflation mechanisms) to fit your chain's specific needs, missing opportunities to incentivize behaviors like staking or ecosystem participation.
- **Potential for higher costs in certain cases**: For high-volume applications like gaming or social networks, `ETH`-based fees might be more expensive compared to a custom token designed for lower costs.
- **Less ecosystem control**: Without a custom token, there's no ability to create value capture mechanisms or partnerships centered around a native asset, which could limit long-term growth and user engagement in niche ecosystems.
