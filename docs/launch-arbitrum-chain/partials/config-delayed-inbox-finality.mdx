### Configuring Delayed Inbox Finality in Arbitrum Chains

The Delayed Inbox in Arbitrum chains (including Orbit L2s and L3s) allows users to force-include transactions on the parent chain if the sequencer is censoring or delayed, ensuring liveness. "Finality" here refers to when delayed messages (e.g., retryable tickets or deposits) are released and executable, typically after a sequencer delay window (default ~24 hours) plus finalization on the parent chain (L1 or L2). Configuration controls this timing, balancing speed and security.

Configurations are set at deployment (via RollupCreator) or post-launch (via contract calls like SequencerInbox.setMaxTimeVariation). For Orbit chains, use the Orbit SDK for testing; changes may require governance (e.g., DAO) for public chains. Always audit and test on devnet to avoid re-org risks.

#### Steps to Configure Delayed Inbox Finality

1. **Understand Key Components**:

   - **Sequencer Inbox Max Time Variation**: Defines boundaries for sequencer manipulation of blocks/timestamps and force-inclusion periods.
   - **Sequencer Node Flags**: Adjust how the sequencer waits for parent chain finality (L1 vs. L2) and block confirmations.
   - For L3s settling to Arbitrum One/Nova, finality can depend on L1 batches or L2 DACerts, typically ~tens of minutes by default.

2. **Set Max Time Variation Parameters (Core for Force-Inclusion Period)**:

   - Deploy or update via the `SequencerInbox` contract on the parent chain.
   - **Via RollupCreator (at Deployment)**: Include in the `sequencerInboxMaxTimeVariation` field of the config JSON.
     Example config snippet:
     ```
     {
       "sequencerInboxMaxTimeVariation": {
         "delayBlocks": 5760,
         "futureBlocks": 12,
         "delaySeconds": 86400,
         "futureSeconds": 3600
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Post-Launch Update**: Call `SequencerInbox.setMaxTimeVariation(uint64 delayBlocks, uint64 futureBlocks, uint64 delaySeconds, uint64 futureSeconds)` as the chain owner.
     - Use tools like Foundry or ethers.js for the call.
     - Example in Solidity (via script):
       ```
       SequencerInbox sequencerInbox = SequencerInbox(rollup.sequencerInbox());
       sequencerInbox.setMaxTimeVariation(5760, 12, 86400, 3600);
       ```

3. **Configure Sequencer Node for Finality Behavior**:

   - Edit the sequencer node's config (e.g., in docker-compose.yml or nodeConfig.json).
   - Enable delayed sequencer: `--node.delayed-sequencer.enable=true` (required for reading delayed inbox).
   - Switch to L2 finality (for L3s): `--node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false` (relies on L2 instead of L1).
   - Reduce confirmation distance for faster finality: `--node.delayed-sequencer.finalize-distance=1` (waits for only 1 L2 block).
   - Restart the sequencer node after changes.

4. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Use Orbit SDK to spin up a devnet: `npx @arbitrum/orbit-sdk deploy --config path/to/config.json`.
   - Monitor via RPC (e.g., query SequencerInbox.maxTimeVariation()).
   - For production, propose upgrades via DAO if needed; ensure validators update to the new WASM root if STF-impacting.

#### Parameters

- **futureBlocks**: Max blocks sequencer can postdate timestamps (default: 12).
- **delaySeconds**: Seconds after which force-inclusion is possible (default: 86400, 24 hours).
- **futureSeconds**: Max seconds for postdating (default: 3600, 1 hour).
- **use-merge-finality**: Flag to use L1 (true, default) or L2 finality (false).
- **finalize-distance**: L2 blocks to wait for confirmation (default: higher value; set to 1 for ~1-minute finality).

#### Decisions Regarding Configuration

Use the table below for key decisions, focusing on trade-offs between speed, security, and complexity.

| Decision Area                                           | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                    | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Finality Layer (L1 vs. L2)**                          | Set `--node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false` for L2 reliance in L3s settling to Arbitrum One/Nova. Use for faster deposits via L2 DACerts. | L2 finality speeds up (~tens of minutes) but risks if L2 re-orgs; L1 (default) is more secure but slower (waits for Ethereum finality).                                   |
| **Force-Inclusion Period (delayBlocks/delaySeconds)**   | Shorten for quicker user-forced inclusions; set via contract call or config. Ideal for high-UX apps.                                                  | Shorter periods reduce censorship resistance wait times but increase spam/DoS risks; longer (default 24h) enhances security but frustrates users during sequencer issues. |
| **Confirmation Distance (finalize-distance)**           | Set to 1 for ~one-minute finality; configure in sequencer flags.                                                                                      | Faster finality improves deposits/bridges but heightens re-org risks on un-finalized blocks; higher values prioritize safety over speed.                                  |
| **Timestamp Manipulation (futureBlocks/futureSeconds)** | Adjust for sequencer flexibility in posting; defaults allow minor adjustments.                                                                        | Higher values aid in handling network variability but risk sequencer abuse (e.g., MEV); lower limits enhance predictability.                                              |
| **Deployment vs. Upgrade**                              | Set at genesis for new Orbit chains; update post-launch for live ones.                                                                                | Genesis is simpler/no disruption; upgrades require governance and may cause temporary delays but allow iteration.                                                         |
| **Chain Mode (Rollup vs. AnyTrust)**                    | Applies to both; AnyTrust may layer with DAC for DA.                                                                                                  | Rollup ties directly to L1 finality (more secure); AnyTrust enables faster configs but adds committee trust.                                                              |
| **When to Customize**                                   | For UX-critical apps (e.g., gaming needing fast deposits); use defaults for standard security.                                                        | Customization boosts speed/utility but demands testing/audits; defaults minimize risks for general-purpose chains.                                                        |
