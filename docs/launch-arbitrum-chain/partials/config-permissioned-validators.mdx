### Benefits of Choosing Permissioned Validators in Arbitrum Orbit Chains

Permissioned validators in Arbitrum Orbit chains restrict participation in state validation and dispute resolution (e.g., challenging assertions) to an allow-listed set of trusted parties, often managed by the chain's governance (e.g., DAO). This permissioned model contrasts with permissionless models enabled by the BoLD protocol, where anyone can participate by bonding funds. As of July 2025, permissioned setups are still recommended for certain chains, such as Arbitrum Nova, due to security considerations, particularly after the BoLD activation on mainnet chains. Key benefits include:

- **Mitigation of Delay Attacks**: By limiting validation to trusted entities, permissioned models prevent malicious actors from spamming disputes to indefinitely delay confirmations or withdrawals, a risk in permissionless systems where multiple challenges can extend resolution times.
- **Enhanced Security for Lower-TVL Chains**: Suitable for chains with modest total value locked (e.g., Arbitrum Nova at ~$46M TVL), where high bond requirements in permissionless setups could centralize control among capital-rich entities, potentially reducing decentralization. Permissioned ensures that at least one honest validator (e.g., via DAC in AnyTrust) can maintain chain liveness and safety.
- **Simplified Governance and Control**: Allow-lists managed by DAOs or admins provide direct oversight, enabling easier coordination, reduced spam, and alignment with project-specific needs like enterprise compliance or specialized use cases (e.g., gaming or AI chains).
- **Lower Operational Risks and Costs**: Avoids the complexity of handling unbounded disputes or high-stakes bonding, making it more accessible for smaller teams. In AnyTrust mode, permissioned DACs enable features like fast withdrawals (~15 minutes) while keeping costs low without exposing the chain to external challengers.
- **Balanced Decentralization with Practicality**: Retains Ethereum's security inheritance while introducing controlled trust assumptions, ideal for chains transitioning to full decentralization without immediate exposure to griefing or resource exhaustion attacks.

### Decisions Regarding Permissioned Validators

Choosing permissioned validators is often a decision made at genesis or during an upgrade, tied to BoLD activation and chain mode (e.g., Rollup vs. AnyTrust). It's recommended for most Orbit chains, unless high TVL justifies permissionless risks. Test via the Orbit SDK and consult Offchain Labs. Key decisions are below:

| Decision Area                       | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Permissioned vs. Permissionless** | Evaluate based on TVL, use case, and security needs: Keep permissioned for lower-TVL or risk-averse chains (e.g., Nova); switch to permissionless via BoLD for mature, high-TVL ecosystems needing broader participation. Requires upgrading Nitro contracts and DAO approval for public chains. | Permissioned offers safety and control but limits decentralization/inclusivity; permissionless enhances resilience but risks delays/centralization from high bonds. |
| **Allow-List Configuration**        | Define trusted validators (e.g., DAO members, reputable nodes) in the Rollup contract; add/remove via admin actions. For AnyTrust, align with DAC setup (e.g., honesty threshold `K=2`).                                                                                                         | Restricts access to known entities for security but requires ongoing governance; poor choices can lead to collusion risks.                                          |
| **Validation Strategy**             | Select node strategies such as Watchtower (monitor only), Defensive (challenge bad assertions), or MakeNodes (create assertions); enable BoLD with `--node.bold.enable=true` for hybrid support.                                                                                                 | Defensive/MakeNodes provide active security but higher gas costs; Watchtower is low-effort but passive.                                                             |
| **Bonding and Economic Model**      | Set bond sizes (e.g., equivalent to 3,600 `ETH`) and tokens (`ERC-20` like `WETH`); include incentives such as 3-4% APR interest or 1% bounties for honest validators.                                                                                                                           | High bonds deter attacks but limit accessibility; low bonds increase spam risks in hybrid setups.                                                                   |
| **Infrastructure and Node Setup**   | Configure nodes with parameters like --node.staker.enable=true, private keys, and funds for `ETH`/`WETH`; integrate with RaaS for managed allow-lists.                                                                                                                                           | Self-hosting offers control but needs expertise; RaaS simplifies but adds fees/vendor dependency.                                                                   |
| **Censorship and Delay Features**   | For L3 chains, parameterize Delay Buffer to handle parent censorship; plan for 2-day Security Council grace periods.                                                                                                                                                                             | Mitigates delays but adds complexity; ineffective params can prolong disputes up to 50 days.                                                                        |
| **When to Choose or Skip**          | Opt for permissioned in low-TVL/experimental chains (e.g., gaming); skip for DeFi that requires maximum decentralization (use permissionless). Monitor for 2025 BoLD evolutions.                                                                                                                 | Reduces overhead but may hinder Stage 2 rollup status; benefits security-focused projects.                                                                          |
