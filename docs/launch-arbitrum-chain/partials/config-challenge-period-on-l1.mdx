### Benefits of the Challenge Period Being Enforced on L1 in Arbitrum Orbit Chains

The challenge period in Arbitrum Orbit chains is a window during which state assertions (updates to the chain's state) posted to the parent chain—typically Ethereum L1 or an Arbitrum L2 that settles to Ethereum—can be disputed by validators if they are deemed fraudulent. Enforcement on L1 means the period is measured using Ethereum's block numbers, and any challenges or resolutions occur on Ethereum for ultimate finality. This challenge is core to the optimistic rollup mechanism in Orbit's Nitro stack, with defaults around 7 days (approximately 45,818 L1 blocks). As of July 2025, benefits include:

- **Enhanced Security and Fraud Detection**: By tying the period to L1 blocks, it leverages Ethereum's robust consensus and decentralization, allowing sufficient time (e.g., ~1 week by default) for honest validators to identify and challenge invalid assertions. This link prevents premature finalization of fraudulent states, ensuring the chain inherits Ethereum's security guarantees.
- **Trustless and Permissionless Verification**: Anyone can participate in challenges on L1 (especially with BoLD upgrades enabling permissionless validation), minimizing trust assumptions. Disputes are resolved transparently on Ethereum, providing verifiable fraud proofs and protecting against sequencer malice or errors.
- **Balanced Finality and Liveness**: The fixed window ensures predictable state confirmation, enabling safe withdrawals and cross-chain interactions after the period ends. In BoLD-enhanced chains, it resists delay attacks by bounding resolution times (e.g., ~6.4 days + grace), maintaining chain progress even under multi-adversary disputes.
- **Customization Flexibility with L1 Anchoring**: Developers can adjust the period's length while keeping enforcement on L1, allowing tailored security levels (e.g., shorter for low-stakes apps). This flexibility contrasts with faster but less secure alternatives, such as AnyTrust's 15-minute fast withdrawals, which trade L1 enforcement for speed via DAC.
- **Cost Efficiency in Resolution**: Challenges only escalate to L1 if disputed, keeping routine operations off-chain while ensuring high-stakes resolutions benefit from Ethereum's economic security and immutability.

This setup is particularly valuable for high-value DeFi or enterprise apps, as seen in chains like Arbitrum One, where L1 enforcement has supported billions in TVL with minimal incidents.

### Decisions Regarding the Challenge Period

The challenge period is customizable in Orbit chains, set at deployment and adjustable post-launch by the chain owner. Key decisions involve balancing security, user experience, and costs, often tested using the Orbit SDK. In AnyTrust mode, fast withdrawals can bypass the full period using DAC, but standard challenges still enforce on L1 fallback. The table below details decisions:

| Decision Area                                              | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Challenge Period Length (confirmPeriodBlocks)**     | Set the number of parent chain (L1) blocks for the primary window (default: 45,818, ~1 week on Ethereum). Customize via RollupCreator at deployment or Rollup.setConfirmPeriodBlocks() post-launch. Shorter (e.g., 30,000 blocks, ~4.5 days) for faster finality.                                                    | Shorter periods speed up withdrawals but reduce security (less time for challenges); longer periods enhance fraud detection but increase delays/costs for users. Align to parent block time (e.g., Ethereum ~12-15s/block). |
| **Extra Challenge Time Buffer (extraChallengeTimeBlocks)** | Configure a buffer for resolving pending disputes (default: 200 blocks, ~40 minutes). Adjustable via Rollup.setExtraChallengeTimeBlocks(). Use for edge cases such as sequencer delays.                                                                                                                              | Adds reliability in disputes but extends total time if challenges occur; minimal for low-conflict chains but crucial under BoLD for multi-challenges.                                                                       |
| **Chain Mode (Rollup vs. AnyTrust)**                       | Enforce full L1 challenge in Rollup for maximum security; use AnyTrust for optional fast paths (15 minutes via DAC) with L1 fallback. Rollup prioritizes L1 enforcement for trustlessness, but at higher costs. AnyTrust reduces times/costs, but introduces DAC trust, which is unsuitable for high-security needs. |
| **BoLD Integration**                                       | Enable BoLD for permissionless challenges and bounded delays; set grace periods (e.g., 2 days for Security Council).                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Boosts decentralization/resilience but adds complexity (e.g., bond sizes); skip for permissioned setups to avoid spam risks.                                                                                                |
| **Parent Chain Selection**                                 | Settle to Ethereum L1 for direct enforcement or Arbitrum L2 (e.g., One) for layered but still L1-secured challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Direct L1 maximizes security but increases fees; L2 parents lower costs but add intermediary delays.                                                                                                                        |
| **When to Customize or Keep Default**                      | Use defaults for general-purpose chains; customize for specific use cases (e.g., shorter for gaming). Monitor for dynamic period proposals. Customization offers flexibility but requires governance/owner control; defaults ensure standard security but may hinder the user experience in fast-paced apps.         |
