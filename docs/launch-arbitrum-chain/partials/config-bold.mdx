### Benefits of Using BoLD Permissionless Validation in Arbitrum Orbit Chains

BoLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) is a dispute resolution protocol upgrade for Arbitrum chains, including Orbit-deployed L2s and L3s, that enables permissionless validation while maintaining Ethereum's security. As of July 2025, BoLD has been activated on mainnet chains, such as Arbitrum One and Nova, following DAO approvals in early 2025, allowing any honest party to challenge assertions without requiring whitelists. This position shifts from permissioned models, enhancing decentralization. Key benefits include:

- **Permissionless Participation and Inclusivity**: Anyone can validate or challenge state assertions by bonding funds, fostering community involvement, and reducing reliance on centralized validators. Decentralization makes chains more socially inclusive, enabling individuals or teams to secure the network and advance to Stage 2 rollup status according to L2Beat criteria.
- **Resistance to Delay Attacks**: Disputes resolve in a fixed time window (e.g., ~6.4 days challenge period + 2-day grace + small delta), preventing malicious actors from indefinitely delaying confirmations or withdrawals via spam challenges. This fixed window ensures liveness and safety, with honest parties always winning if they participate.
- **Enhanced Security and Decentralization**: Uses interactive fraud proofs with a single-honest-party assumption, minimizing costs for honest validators in multi-adversary scenarios. It boosts network resilience, censorship resistance (especially for L3s via optional timeout features), and overall security without P2P communication between parties.
- **Faster Dispute Resolution and Efficiency**: Parallel challenges and multi-level dissections (block, big-step, one-step) lead to quicker outcomes, with Ethereum as the final referee. This enhancement supports efficient all-vs-all disputes, reducing latency to a maximum of 7 days, with an additional delay of up to 7 days on settlements.
- **Access to Latest Arbitrum Features**: Adopting BoLD upgrades the chain to the newest Nitro software, including performance optimizations, Stylus VM support, and custom `ERC-20` bonding tokens (e.g., project's native token), while preserving existing security primitives.
- **Improved User Experience for Withdrawals**: Safer, more predictable exits to parent chains (e.g., Ethereum or Arbitrum One), with incentives like 1% defender bounties and 3-4% APR interest on bonds for honest validators.

Examples include chains like ApeChain and Destra Network, which leverage BoLD for secure, decentralized AI and gaming applications.

### Decisions Regarding BoLD Permissionless Validation

Adopting BoLD is an upgrade process for Orbit chains, often requiring DAO governance for public chains, and decisions are largely immutable post-deployment. Use the Orbit SDK for testing, and consult Offchain Labs via their form for guidance. Key decisions focus on balancing security, costs, and accessibility, with recommendations to keep validation permissions in place unless risks are mitigated. The table below outlines the main areas:

| Decision Area                          | Key Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Adoption and Upgrade Path**          | Decide to upgrade Nitro node software and deploy new rollup contracts on the parent chain (e.g., Ethereum or Arbitrum One). For public chains, prepare an AIP via the DAO and notify Offchain Labs of the timelines to warn users about potential temporary withdrawal delays (~6.4 days added).                                                     | Ensures the latest features but requires downtime/coordination; skipping keeps the chain on older, permissioned models vulnerable to delays.           |
| **Permissioned vs. Permissionless**    | It is strongly recommended to keep permissioned for most chains due to the associated risks; enable permissionless only after rigorous testing (e.g., similar to Arbitrum One configurations). Consult Offchain Labs if pursuing permissionless.                                                                                                     | Permissionless boosts decentralization/inclusivity but increases spam/resource exhaustion risks; permissioned is safer/cheaper but less decentralized. |
| **Bond Sizes and Token Choice**        | Set high assertion/challenge bonds (e.g., 3,600 `ETH` equivalent) to deter attacks; choose `ERC-20` token (default `WETH` for liquidity/stability). Use bonding pools for accessibility.                                                                                                                                                             | High bonds enhance security but limit participation to capital-rich entities; low bonds risk delays/griefing, especially for low-TVL chains.           |
| **Censorship Timeout Feature**         | Enable optional feature (disabled by default) to reduce force-inclusion windows if sequencer/parent censors; configure delay buffer/threshold based on batch posting frequency.                                                                                                                                                                      | Improves L3 resistance to censorship but requires careful params to avoid ineffectiveness; adds complexity for non-L3 chains.                          |
| **Infrastructure and Risk Mitigation** | Plan for higher costs (monitoring, scaling during attacks) and incident response; collaborate with RaaS providers (e.g., Zeeve) for robust setups. Budget for off-chain compute (~$2.50/sub-challenge, unreimbursed). Reduces attack risks but increases operational overhead; insufficient preparation can lead to live issues or financial losses. |
| **Security Council and Incentives**    | Retain 2-day grace for emergency interventions; leverage bounties (1% of confiscated bonds) and interest (3-4% APR) to incentivize validators.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Balances decentralization with safety but maintains some centralization; incentives aid participation but may not cover all costs.                     |
| **When to Use or Skip**                | Use for high-TVL/security-focused chains (e.g., DeFi/gaming, such as ApeChain), which require decentralization; skip for low-TVL/experimental chains where permissioned solutions suffice or the risks outweigh the benefits. Test via devnet.                                                                                                       | Maximizes security/resilience but adds complexity/costs; ideal for mature ecosystems, per 2025 trends in Orbit vs. OP Stack comparisons.               |
