BoLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) is a dispute resolution protocol that enables permissionless validation, allowing anyone to propose, challenge, and defend chain states by bonding `ETH`, with disputes resolved in a fixed-time window (typically around 7-14 days, depending on the chain). For Arbitrum chains, BoLD is available as an optional upgrade via the Nitro stack, enhancing decentralization and security while setting states to a parent chain like Ethereum or Arbitrum One.

| Validation & Decentraliation  | - Enables permissionless validation, allowing anyone to propose and defend states, increasing relsilience and inclusivity <br /> - Supports trustless bonding pools, letting groups pool `ETH` to participate without high individual capital barriers, promoting broader decentralization                                                                                                                                                                            | - High bond requirements (e.g., potentially thousands of `ETH` for assertions) may centralize participation to well-funded entities, limiting smaller validators. <br /> - No built-in protocol-level incentives for validators could lead to free-riding, where parties rely on others to defend the chain.                                                                                                                         |
| Security & Dispute Resolution | - Mitigates delay attacks by enforcing a bounded dispute window (e.g., ~7 days plus grace periods), ensuring predictable resolution even against multiple malicious challengers. <br /> - Enhances withdrawal security to the parent chain by limiting indefinite delays, and includes features like Delay Buffer for censorship resistance. <br /> - A single honest party can win disputes against any number of dishonest ones, with audited code for reliability. | - Disputes can still delay all withdrawals (up to ~14 days total), impacting user experience and liquidity. <br /> - For lower-TVL Arbitrum chains, high bonds might need adjustment, trading off security against centralization risks or vulnerability to spam. <br /> - Potential censorship risks for L3 Arbitrum chains (e.g., parent chain is censored, delays could extend up to 50 days in extreme cases, though mitigated). |
| Economics & Incentives        | - Bonds deter actors, with honest parties refunded plus a 1% defender's bounty and gas reimbursements, plus potential service fees (3-4% annualized `ETH` yield) from chain owners. <br /> - Fixed costs and resource ratios prevent dishonest parties from inflating expenses for honest validators.                                                                                                                                                                 | - Significant capital lockup in bonds creates opportunity costs and risks (e.g., loss if proven wrong), potentially prohibitive for smaller chains. <br /> - KYC requirements for fee eligibility may exclude some participants, like those in sanctioned regions. <br /> - Operational costs for onchain proofs and disputes (gas, computation), add complexity and expenses.                                                       |
| Implementations & Maturity    | - Modular upgrade for Arbitrum chains <br /> - Community testing via testnets and visualizers available for easier adoption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | - Increased protocol complexity may require additional tooling and expertise to manage. <br /> - Reliance on parent chain for final proofs; issues there could affect Arbitrum chain disputes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
