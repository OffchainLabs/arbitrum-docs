## Pros of using Rollup mode

- **Security**: Provides maximum security and decentralization by inheriting full Ethereum-grade security without additional trust assumptions beyond the base layer.
- **Strong Data Availability**: Ensures strong data availability and censorship resistance, as all transaction data is publicly posted on the parent chain, allowing anyone to validate and detect fraud.
- **Trustless and permissionless**: Fully trustless and permissionless operation, requiring only one honest validator for the system to remain secure, making it ideal for high-value applications like DeFi protocols.
- **Compatibility**: High compatibility with Ethereum, including support for EVM-equivalent smart contracts and tools, while maintaining robust fraud-proof mechanisms.

## Cons of using Rollup mode

- **Higher costs**: Higher transaction fees due to the cost of posting all data on-chain to the parent layer.
- **Withdrawal times**: Longer withdrawal times, typically involving a seven-day challenge period for fraud proofs before funds can be moved back to the parent layer.
- **Throughput**: Potentially lower throughput compared to AnyTrust mode, as the on-chain data posting can limit scalability for high-volume, low-value transactions.
