:::info Native Mint/Burn for Custom Gas Tokens

Starting with **ArbOS 51 Dia**, Arbitrum chains have the option to use a **native interop token with mint/burn** as their custom gas tokens via third-party interoperability providers (such as LayerZero OFTs, xERC20s, or native USDC) instead of using the canonical "lock and mint" bridge.

To enable this feature for your chain, see our guide on [enabling native mint/burn for gas tokens](/launch-arbitrum-chain/configure-your-chain/common/gas/configure-native-mint-burn-gas-token).

:::note

Arbitrum provides the infrastructure for this feature, but does not provide the bridge adapter itself. To use this feature, you must directly coordinate with your chosen bridge provider to build, audit, and deploy a custom adapter contract.
