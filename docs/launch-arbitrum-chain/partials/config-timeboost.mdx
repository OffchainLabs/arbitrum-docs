Timeboost is an optional transaction ordering policy that can be enabled on any Arbitrum chain, including Arbitrum (Orbit) chains. It replaces the First-come, First-served (FCFS) ordering by introducing a sealed-bid, second-price auction for an "express lane." This gives the auction winner a temporary time advantage (default: 200ms) for submitting transactions ahead of others, allowing the chain owner to capture Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) from activities like arbitrage or liquidations.

| Revenue and MEV Capture                | Captures MEV (e.g., from arbitrage or backrunning) as auction revenue for the chain owner, potentially generating significant income. Revenue can be redistributed to users, apps, or burned, creating new value accrual paths. Flexible bid tokens (e.g., any `ERC-20`) allow customization. | Revenue isn't guaranteed; depends on MEV volumeâ€”if your Arbitrum chain has low activity, auctions may yield little or nothing. Setup/maintenance costs (e.g., auctioneer infrastructure) could exceed benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Network performance and spam reduction | Reduces spam and congestion by shifting searcher resources from hardware-based latency races to auctions, potentially lowering network stress and improving overall efficiency. Maintains industry-leading block times (250ms) and protects against harmful MEV via private mempool.          | Introduces a ~200ms delay for non-express lane transactions (increasing average response time to ~450ms), which could slightly degrade UX for regular users during active auction rounds. Express lane transactions may drop if not sequenced within ~1.25 seconds, adding minor reliability risks.                                                                                                              |
| User and ecosystem impact              | Preserves strong UX with minimal changes for most users; enables new models like searchers reselling express lane access, potentially boosting ecosystem innovation. Socializes MEV benefits back to the chain (e.g., via DAO), reducing negative externalities from searcher competition.    | Risk of centralized dominance: well-funded entites might monopolize auctions, though mitigated by competitive bidding and short advantage (200ms). Could enable new MEV strategies (e.g., front-running liquidations), harming users or protocols in some cases. Adds friction for latency-sensitive features like onchain limit order books, potentially wideing spreads or increasing risks for market makers. |
| Flexibility and Implementation         | Fully optional and customizable (e.g,. adjust delays, auction cadence); works with decentralized sequencers and reverts to FCFS if needed. Ideal for Arbitrum chain owners seeking control over ordering policies.                                                                            | Requires continuous bidding, which may not suit spontaneous MEV opportunities, no reordering or full control for winners, limiting utility in some scenarios. Potential for secondary markets add complexity; needs ongoing monitoring for risks like collusion or abuse. Bid deposits tie up liquidity (withdrawal delay ~2 minutes).                                                                           |
