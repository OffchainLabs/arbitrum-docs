Configuring the challenge period on L1 means deploying your Arbitrum chain as a Layer 2 Rollup that settles directly to Ethereum, where assertions are posted, challenged, and confirmed using L1 contracts and block numbers. A Layer 2 configuration contrasts with a Layer 3 configuration, where the chain settles to Arbitrum and the challenge period runs on the L2. The default challenge period is 6.4 days, but it can be customized via the `confirmPeriodBlocks` parameter during deployment or post-deployment by the chain owner. The chain owner can reset the `confirmPeriodBlocks`, using `rollupAdmin.setConfirmPeriodBlocks`.

| Security                    | - Directly inherits Ethereum's full L1 security model, with no dependency on an intermediary L2's assumptions or potential vulnerabilities. <br /> - Challenges are resolved on the most decentralized and tested layer, reducing risks from L2-specific issues | - No significant cons here; L1 offers the highest baseline security, though custom shorter periods could theoretically reduce time for fraud detection.                                                                                                                       |
| Costs                       | - Avoids compounded fees from an L2 intermediary, potentially simplifying long-term economics for high-security needs                                                                                                                                           | - Higher operational costs: Posting transaction blobs and resolving challenges uses expensive L1 gas (e.g., calldata fees on Ethereum are higher) <br /> - Less suitable for cost-sensitive applications, as L2 settlement can reduce data availability and posting expenses. |
| Finality & Withdrawal times | Faster overall finality for withdrawals directly to L1: ~7 days default challenge period <br /> - Simpler path to Ethereum mainnet settlement, beneficial for users needing quick access to L1 liquidity                                                        | - Still requires a ~7 day wait for standard withdrawals, which can feel slow compared to zero-knowledge Rollups or optimized AnyTrust setups <br /> - No benefit from L2's faster block times for intra-layer operations                                                      |
| Customization & Flexibility | - The challenge period is easily customizable (e.g., via `Rollup.setConfirmPeriodBlocks`) to balance security and speed, using reliable L1 block timing <br /> - Suitable for applications requiring high-value transfers or strict L1 alignment                | - Less flexibility in leveraging L2-specific features (e.g., cheaper data availability committees in AnyTrust mode) <br /> - Customization options are similar to L2 settlement, but adjustments may incur higher gas costs on L1                                             |
| Overall usability           | - Ideal for projects prioritizing maximum decentralization and direct Ethereum integration, avoiding "security stacking" risks                                                                                                                                  | - May limit scalability for high-throughput apps due to L1 congestion or costs; L3 setups on L2 can offer better performance for specialized use cases                                                                                                                        |
