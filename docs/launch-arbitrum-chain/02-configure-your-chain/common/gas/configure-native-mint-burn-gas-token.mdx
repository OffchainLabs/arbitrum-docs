:::caution Bridge counterparty risk

While this feature allows an Arbitrum chain to use native interop tokens as gas tokens via third-party protocols, it introduces new trust assumptions. In a standard Arbitrum chain, the canonical bridge is the sole authority for minting the chain's gas token, inheriting the security of the parent chain.

However, by using a third-party bridge for the chain's gas token, your chain's gas token—and thus its liveness—becomes directly dependent on the security and integrity of the third-party bridge provider.

:::info

While Native Mint/Burn was introduced in ArbOS 41, we strongly recommend that teams upgrade to [ArbOS 51 Dia](/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51) to enable this feature.

:::

## Recommended configuration

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that the chain has:

| Item               | Minimum version                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nitro-contracts`  | [v3.1.1](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/releases/tag/v3.1.1) or higher (includes the ERC20MigrationOutbox)                       |
| `nitro-node`       | [v3.9.3](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3) or higher (includes the fix for `ArbNativeTokenManager` precompile inclusion) |
| `go-ethereum` fork | Included in [ArbOS 51 Dia](/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51) (please use the latest WASM module root) or later                |

We suggest the following baseline or values for production chains:

- ArbOS version 51 or later. The latest WASM module root for ArbOS 51 Dia is `0x8a7513bf7bb3e3db04b0d982d0e973bcf57bf8b88aef7c6d03dba3a81a56a499`
- Call [`ArbOwner.setNativeTokenManagementFrom`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-precompile-interfaces/blob/f49a4889b486fd804a7901203f5f663cfd1581c8/ArbOwner.sol#L38-L40) to activate with a future timestamp ≥ 7 days ahead. This is recommended for chains which are already live.
- Native-token owners list: only the bridge adapter contract(s) to minimize the attack surface.
- Outbox sweep bot: run once per hour to prevent stray collateral build-up.
- Adapter contract must implement replay‑protection and supply accounting as these requirements are out-of-scope for ArbOS.

## How to configure the feature for your chain

:::info

The native token mint/burn feature is currently not available for implementation at chain genesis. The ability to activate it during chain initialization will be part of a future release.

:::

### Enable the feature post-genesis

Below steps show the flow a RaaS / chain team can use to allowlist a bridge adapter. The example below uses a Foundry call, but you can also use other tools to interact with the precompiles directly.

1. Update your chain to [ArbOS 51 Dia](/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51) binaries and deploy the consensus-v51 WASM root.
2. Call [`setNativeTokenManagementFrom`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-precompile-interfaces/blob/f49a4889b486fd804a7901203f5f663cfd1581c8/ArbOwner.sol#L38-L40) with the chain owner and a UNIX timestamp that is 7+ days in the future to enable the feature, otherwise the call will fail.

   :::important

   The feature becomes live once the chain timestamp passes `NativeTokenManagementFromTime`. Until then, the `add/removeNativeTokenOwner` call will revert.

   :::

3. Deploy your bridge adapter (e.g., LayerZero OFT) and note the contract address.
4. Add the deployed bridge adapter as a native-token owner:
   ```shell
   cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 \
     "addNativeTokenOwner(address)" \
     {0xTheNewOwnerToBeAdded} \
     --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
     --rpc-url $RPC_URL
   ```
5. _(Optional)_ Deploy `ERC20MigrationOutbox` on L1 and run a bot to call `sweep()` on a desired cadence.
6. Chain owners should monitor the following events:
   - `OwnerActs(0xaeb3a464, address indexed owner, bytes data)` to see adding native owner
   - `OwnerActs(0x96a3751d, address indexed owner, bytes data)` to see removing native owner
   - `NativeTokenMinted` and `NativeTokenBurned` to see token mint and burn events

### Temporarily disabling the mint/burn feature

There may be situations where you want to disable the feature temporarily, e.g., to investigate a bridge bug or supply imbalance. All calls below are made from an [**ArbOwner**](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-precompile-interfaces/) wallet. These commands are for RaaS / chain teams, bridge teams have their own operating procedures.

1. Inspect the current list of owners.

   ```shell
   cast call 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b \
     "getAllNativeTokenOwners()(address[])" \
     --rpc-url $RPC_URL
   ```

2. Remove each owner.

   ```shell
   cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 \
     "removeNativeTokenOwner(address)" \
     {0xTheOwnerToBeRemoved} \
     --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
     --rpc-url $RPC_URL
   ```

   `mintNativeToken` and `burnNativeToken` now revert because no authorized senders remain.

   Canonical bridge exits are now open, warn liquidity partners.

3. Verify the pause.

   ```shell
   cast call 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b \
     "getAllNativeTokenOwners()(address[])" \
     --rpc-url $RPC_URL
   ```

   The list should be empty

4. _(Optional but **recommended**)_ Notify downstream infrastructure: Bridges, indexers, and other relevant teams may need to be informed that canonical exits are open again and the adapter is offline.

**To re-enable the feature later**

- Add the adapter back (no delay if `NativeTokenManagementFromTime` is a past timestamp).

  ```bash
  cast send 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070 \
    "addNativeTokenOwner(address)" \
    {0xTheNewOwnerToBeAdded} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --rpc-url $RPC_URL
  ```

- You can call `GetNativeTokenManagementFrom` to verify `NativeTokenManagementFromTime` value:

  ```jsx

  cast send 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b \
    "getNativeTokenManagementFrom()(uint64)" \
    {0xTheNewOwnerToBeAdded} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --rpc-url $RPC_URL
  ```

### Disabling the native mint/burn feature permanently

1. Remove all native-token owners via `removeNativeTokenOwner`.
2. The `ArbOwner` calls the function `SetNativeTokenManagementFrom(0)` to freeze the action to add or remove the list of trusted adapters (owners). Setting this parameter to `0` disables future modifications to `NativeTokenOwners` ; do this after the list is empty. In other words, it will lock the token-owner list forever: no new owners can be added, and nobody can re-enable Native Mint/Burn.
3. To verify behavior: `getAllNativeTokenOwners()` should return `[]` (empty list)
4. Canonical-bridge withdrawals resume automatically once the list of native-token owners is empty.

## Security checklist

| Risk                                 | Mitigation                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin key compromise enables minting | Seven-day timelock, set up alerting on `NativeTokenManagementFromTime` updates                      |
| Buggy adapter over-mints tokens      | Remove owner would block mint/burn; users can burn & exit via canonical bridge after owners removed |
| Collateral split across two exits    | Canonical bridge auto-blocks withdrawals when owners exist; run Outbox sweep                        |

## FAQs

### Who should read this page?

- Bridge/infra engineers building an adapter that mints native gas.
- RaaS/chain operators who need to allowlist such an adapter and run the sweeper bot.

### Can I run the feature on an older ArbOS version?

While native mint/burn was technically introduced in ArbOS 41, we strongly recommend upgrading to [ArbOS 51 Dia](/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos51) for those enabling this feature.

### What happens to value-bearing withdrawals once I disable the feature?

When the last native-token owner is removed, Nitro automatically re-opens canonical-bridge withdrawals. No additional action is needed.

### How can developers get the timestamp value of `NativeTokenManagementFromTime`?

Filter event `OwnerActs(bytes4 indexed method, address indexed owner, bytes data)` with first index `0xbdb8f707` to get all results, and decode the latest result's data field to get the last valid timestamp. That timestamp would be the point after which `ArbOwner`'s can take action to `nativeTokenOwner` list.

:::caution Testing Responsibility

While Offchain Labs has conducted comprehensive [system tests](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/system_tests/arbos_upgrade_test.go#L292)
to verify the core ArbOS logic for native mint/burn functionality, this does not cover your specific
implementation.

**Individual teams are responsible to:**

- Thoroughly test their own adapter contracts and app-layer solutions.
- Verify the security and collateralization of their specific third-party token providers (e.g., LayerZero, xERC20).
- Ensure their custom configurations are compatible with their chain's unique environment.
