## What is this feature? 
Orbit chain operators are increasingly looking to deploy chains with pre-existing state, by loading an initial state in a file such as `genesis.json`. 
Specifically, Raases want to predeploy smart contracts (like Gnosis Safe) to an Orbit chain so they exist at genesis, before any user interaction or post-launch governance. 

Initializing from a genesis state would be helpful in the following scenarios:

1. Redeploying a new testnet with pre-existing state if current testnet is broken
2. Deploying additional sibling chains with pre-existing contracts
3. Simplifies RaaSes backend for self-serve, where there can be 100s of testnets being deployed with similar contracts
4. Reduce lift on 3rd-party infrastructure teams to redeploy contracts for new chains


### **What Does This Feature Do?**

1. The Ethereum ecosystem uses `genesis.json` to define the initial state of chains
2. A key use case of `genesis.json` is preloading smart contracts in the very first block
    - Predeploy contract with state set up
    - Bake in a sample set of contracts (compile genesis.json into nitro itself)

### **How to use this feature?**
1. Specify Nitro contract version: v3.2, which is ready for genesis.json support 
2. Generate the genesis.json file and obtain the genesis blockhash and sendRoot hash
    1. Use the genesis-file-generator tool available at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/genesis-file-generator, to generate a standard genesis.json file with a set of pre-deploy contracts.
    2. You can also generate your own genesis.json file, but carefully read [this notice](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/genesis-file-generator#exclamation-important-note-about-the-chain-config-property) before proceeding with the next steps.
    3. After the genesis.json file is created, use [nitro’s genesis-generator tool](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v3.9.2/cmd/genesis-generator/genesis-generator.go) to obtain the genesis blockhash and sendRoot hash.
3. If you want to edit or customize the predeploys, visit the `genesis.json` file and make updates
4. Use the SDK to deploy your chain with the new parameter you get from step 2 `(assertion_hash)`. SDK will generate this — you will need to input blockhash and sendRoot. 
5. Create the node configuration for your node
    1. Craft the node configuration of your node as you normally do, and additionally, set the following properties:
        1. --init.genesis-json-file=/path/to/genesis.json
        2. If nitro already support another way to start the chain - `--chain.initial-l1base-fee` (potential flag)

**Start your chain** with the correct preloaded state.
