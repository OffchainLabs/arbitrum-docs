When you launch an <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a> chain, you set up data availability (DA) during the process. The choice affects how <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> data is stored and accessed for validation, thereby impacting security, costs, and performance.

<a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-chains">Arbitrum Chains</a> support multiple DA options, allowing you
to choose based on your needs (e.g., maximum security vs. lower fees).

## Available data availability options

### 1. Rollup mode (Ethereum/Parent chain DA)

This is the default option for chains that demand security. Transaction data is posted to the <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a> as calldata or blobs (after [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)), using Ethereum's DA layer.

- **Config**: Set `arbitrum.DataAvailabilityCommittee` to `false` in your chain config using the [Chain SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-chain-sdk). No extra set up is needed.

### 2. AnyTrust mode

This mode uses an external Data Availability Committee (DAC), which is a group of permissioned nodes that you choose and run, or outsource (<a data-quicklook-from="raas">RaaS</a>). Instead of posting all the data to the parent chain, the <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer">sequencer</a> sends a lightweight <a data-quicklook-from="data-availability-certificate">Data Availability Certificate</a> (DACert) signed by a sufficient number of DAC members. The data is stored offchain and provided when needed.

- **Config**: Set `arbitrumDataAvailabilityCommittee` to `true` in the chain config.
- Deploy Data Availability Servers (DAS) for each DAC member (using Nitro's DAS software).
- Generate a keyset (BLS public keys + quorum threshold) from DAC members.
- Register the keyset on the `SequencerInbox` contract post-deployment.
- Configure nodes (sequencer, <a data-quicklook-from="batch">batch</a> poster, validators) to connect to DAS endpoints (via REST/RPC aggregators).

For a complete, detailed set of instructions on setting up DAC, DAS, and generating keysets refer to [Get started](/launch-arbitrum-chain/02-configure-your-chain/common/data-availability/data-availability-committees/01-get-started.mdx).

### 3. Alternative data availability (Alt-DA)

In this mode, data is posted to an external modular DA network, such as Celestia, using blobs and Data Availability Sampling. Integration happens through a sidecar server and onchain commmitments, such as [Blobstream](https://docs.celestia.org/learn/blobstream/) for verification.

- **Config**: use a modified Nitro build that includes [Celestia integration](https://docs.celestia.org/build/stacks/nitro-das-server/), such as the celestia-server sidecar. Set the DA provider in your node flags and adjust your preferences, for example, using Celestia as the main provider with a fallback to AnyTrust or Ethereum. Other DA options, such as [EigenDA](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/nitro) or [Avail](https://docs.availproject.org/da/build-with-avail/deploy-rollup-on-avail/Optimium/arbitrum-nitro/overview), can be added in a similar way.
