# Enabling Timeboost for your Arbitrum (Orbit) chain

This guide walks you through the process of enabling Timeboost for your Arbitrum Orbit chain. For a conceptual introduction to Timeboost, see the [Timeboost Introduction](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. An `ERC-20` token address to use as the bid token
2. A Redis server for auctioneer coordination
3. A server to run the auctioneer service
4. A proxy admin contract address

## Overview

Enabling Timeboost requires completing these three steps:

1. Deploy the `ExpressLaneAuction` contract
2. Run Auctioneer Services (bid validator and auction server)
3. Configure your sequencer node to support Timeboost

## Step 1: Deploy the `ExpressLaneAuction` contract

First, clone the orbit-actions repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-actions.git
cd orbit-actions/scripts/foundry/timeboost
```

Create and edit the environment configuration file:

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

Configure the following parameters in your `.env` file:

```shell
## Configuration for DeployExpressLaneAuction.s.sol
PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS=                # Your proxy admin contract address
AUCTIONEER_ADDRESS=                 # Address that will send resolve auction requests
BIDDING_TOKEN_ADDRESS=              # Your ERC20 bid token address
BENEFICIARY_ADDRESS=                # Address to receive bid proceeds
AUCTIONEER_ADMIN_ADDRESS=           # Admin address for the auctioneer
MIN_RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADDRESS=   # Address allowed to set minimum reserve price
RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADDRESS=       # Address allowed to set reserve price
RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADMIN_ADDRESS= # Admin for reserve price setter
BENEFICIARY_SETTER_ADDRESS=         # Address allowed to change beneficiary
ROUND_TIMING_SETTER_ADDRESS=        # Address allowed to adjust round timing
MASTER_ADMIN_ADDRESS=               # Master admin address

MIN_RESERVE_PRICE=0                 # Minimum price for bids (0 recommended for testing)

# Round timing configuration (in seconds)
ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS=60           # Total duration of each round
AUCTION_CLOSING_SECONDS=15          # Time before round end when new bids are closed
RESERVE_SUBMISSION_SECONDS=15       # Time allocated for reserve price submission
```

Deploy the contract:

```shell
forge script --sender $DEPLOYER --rpc-url $CHILD_CHAIN_RPC --slow ./DeployExpressLaneAuction.s.sol -vvv --verify --broadcast
# Use --account XXX / --private-key XXX / --interactive / --ledger to specify the transaction signer
```

Verify successful deployment by checking that the contract returns your configured bid token:

```shell
cast call --rpc-url=<Your-chain's-endpoint> <Your-ExpressLaneAuction-address> "biddingToken()(address)"
```

Example output:

```shell
0xYourBidTokenAddress
```

## Step 2: Run auctioneer services

There are two distinct services to run: the bid validator and the auction server. The bid validator verifies submitted bids, while the auction server sends the winning bid on-chain.

### Prerequisites

The services require the `autonomous-auctioneer` binary, which is included in the Nitro Docker image. Alternatively, you can build it locally by following the [Build Nitro Locally](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/nitro/build-nitro-locally) guide.

To build only the `autonomous-auctioneer` component during the local build process:

```shell
make target/bin/autonomous-auctioneer
```

### Running bid validator service

Start the bid validator with:

```shell
./autonomous-auctioneer \
--bid-validator.auction-contract-address=<Your ExpressLaneAuction address> \
--bid-validator.rpc-endpoint=<Your chain's rpc URL> \
--auctioneer-server.enable=false \
--bid-validator.redis-url=<Your Redis URL> \
--http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
--http.port=<port>
```

### Running auction server service

Start the auction server with:

```shell
./autonomous-auctioneer \
--auctioneer-server.auction-contract-address=<Your ExpressLaneAuction address> \
--auctioneer-server.db-directory=<Your_auctioneer_server_db_directory> \
--auctioneer-server.redis-url=<Your Redis URL> \
--auctioneer-server.use-redis-coordinator=false \
--auctioneer-server.sequencer-endpoint=<Your sequencer URL> \
--auctioneer-server.wallet.private-key=<Your auctioneer private key> \
--bid-validator.enable=false
```

## Step 3: Configure your sequencer node for Timeboost

Update your sequencer node configuration to enable Timeboost functionality. Add the following new config to your sequencer's node configuration file:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "api": [
      // existing APIs
      "auctioneer",
      "timeboost"
    ]
  },
  "ws": {
    "api": [
      // existing APIs
      "auctioneer",
      "timeboost"
    ]
  },
  "execution": {
    "sequencer": {
      "timeboost": {
        "enable": true,
        "auction-contract-address": "<Your-ExpressLaneAuction-address>",
        "auctioneer-address": "<Your-auctioneer-address>",
        "redis-url": "<Your-Redis-URL>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verifying your Timeboost setup

There are multiple ways to confirm that Timeboost is correctly enabled on your chain:

### Periodic startup logs

When you start your sequencer with Timeboost enabled, you'll see periodic logs indicating the start of new express lane auction rounds:

```shell
New express lane auction round
```

This log indicates that the Timeboost mechanism is active and running normally.

### Transaction processing confirmation

After finishing a bid request, look for messages in your sequencer logs such as:

```shell
AuctionResolved: New express lane controller assigned round
```

This message confirms that your sequencer is processing express queue transactions from the express lane controller, and that Timeboost is functioning correctly.

### User interaction verification

Users can interact with Timeboost by submitting bids through the `auctioneer_submitBid` endpoint of your auctioneer service.
For detailed instructions on how users can interact with Timeboost, see [How to Use Timeboost](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/how-to-use-timeboost).

A successful bid submission will trigger the auction resolution process and generate the corresponding logs mentioned above.
