## tldr;

<a data-quicklook-from="timeboost">Arbitrum Timeboost</a> is a novel transaction ordering policy that
can be optionally deployed and enabled for any Arbitrum chain. Timeboost allows a chain owner to capture
some of the available Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) on their blockchain and reduces latency-related
spamming, in exchange for a small impact on user response times (despite block times not changing). It
is therefore recommended that chains only consider deploying and enabling Timeboost if there is substantial
DeFi and related MEV activity (e.g. liquidations, arbitrage, backrunning) on the chain. Please read the
[gentle introduction to Timeboost](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx) to learn more
about how Timeboost works.

As with all features on the Arbitrum stack, Arbitrum chains can adopt Timeboost at their own discretion and on their own timeline. To deploy and enable Arbitrum Timeboost on your chain, please refer to this guide on how to [deploy and configure Timeboost](#enabling-timeboost-for-your-arbitrum-chain).

## Recommended adoption path

It is recommended that most Arbitrum chains **do not** deploy Arbitrum Timeboost, as the benefits do not outweigh the trade-offs in most cases. The primary reason behind this recommendation is based on cost and user experience considerations. The only instances in which Timeboost might make sense are for chains with significant DeFi and related MEV activity, as the potential revenue from bids may outweigh the costs and possible impact on user experience.

Again, Arbitrum chains can adopt Timeboost at their discretion and on their timeline, so this is only a recommendation.

## Benefits of adopting Timeboost

Timeboost enables a chain owner to capture a portion of the available MEV on their blockchain, reducing latency-related spam while preserving the built-in protections and UX benefits that Arbitrum users have come to know and enjoy. A more in-depth overview of the benefits of Timeboost is explored in the [gentle introduction to Timeboost](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx), and also a paper on how Timeboost is more profitable for arbitrageurs compared to other forms of MEV capture, like Priority Gas Auctions (PGA) [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10797).

#### Fair(er) MEV capture

Timeboost provides sophisticated actors (e.g., searchers) with the ability to purchase a fixed time advantage over a specified number of blocks to perform various MEV activities, such as backrunning, liquidations, or arbitrage. This design preserves the use of a private mempool that all Arbitrum chains have by default, and it does not impact block times. This approach protects users from harmful types of MEV (e.g., frontrunning) while maintaining the same block times.

#### Potential revenue capture for chain owners

The auction, run at a fixed cadence, is held off-chain. Bids can be made in any asset the chain owner designates, including custom `ERC-20` tokens. Furthermore, the chain owner has full discretion over how to use the bid proceeds. For example, chain owners may decide to burn the bid proceeds or use the bid proceeds to support the chain in other ways.

It stands to reason that sophisticated actors (e.g., searchers) will bid up to the amount they believe they can profit or realize from the time advantage. Therefore, at equilibrium, one could reasonably expect that the bid proceeds will approach or equal the amount of available MEV on a Timeboost-enabled chain.

#### Potential reduction in latency-based spam

As explained earlier, searchers will be incentivized to bid on-chain for the time advantage, rather than spending money on off-chain hardware to win latency races. Therefore, at equilibrium, one could reasonably expect that the amount of latency-based spam should reduce on a Timeboost-enabled chain. To learn more about this phenomenon, please check out this analysis on how the Timeboost ordering policy impacts backrunning strategies: [TimeBoost and Backrunning: Probabilistic Strategies](https://research.arbitrum.io/t/timeboost-and-backrunning-probabilistic-strategies/9727).

## Trade offs with adopting Timeboost

As mentioned earlier, chain owners should consider several trade-offs when deciding whether to adopt Timeboost. We will cover two of them below.

#### Cost

As explained in the guide on [how to deploy and configure Timeboost](#enabling-timeboost-for-your-arbitrum-chain), there are are three core components to Timeboost:

- An off-chain auctioneer (responsible for receiving and validating bids, and resolving express lane auctions),
- An on-chain smart contract (to manage the express lane auction), and
- A new configuration on the sequencer is implemented to take advantage of the express lane time.

Often times, the cost required to set up, configure, and maintain the infrastructure above (especially the auctioneer) will exceed that of the potential revenue that Timeboost brings in. Most importantly, the revenue that Timeboost can generate for the chain is _not guaranteed_ either.

#### User experience

As explained in the [gentle introduction to Timeboost](/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx), the Timeboost express lane time advantage is implemented by imposing an artificial delay (default: `200ms`) on all non-express lane transactions whenever there is an express lane controller for a round (default: `1 minute`). While Timeboost does not change the default Arbitrum blocktimes (default: `250ms`), this artificial delay _does_ mean that the average response time for a user in the non-express lane is the sum of the artificial delay and the block time of the chain. Note that this artificial delay is only applied when there is an express lane controller for a round, meaning there is no change in user experience if nobody is using Timeboost, even though it is enabled (for the duration of that round).

## Enabling Timeboost for your Arbitrum chain

This guide walks you through the process of enabling Timeboost for your Arbitrum Orbit chain. For a conceptual introduction to Timeboost, see the [Timeboost Introduction](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/gentle-introduction).

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. An `ERC-20` token address to use as the bid token
2. A Redis server for auctioneer coordination
3. A server to run the auctioneer service
4. A proxy admin contract address

### Overview

Enabling Timeboost requires completing these three steps:

1. Deploy the `ExpressLaneAuction` contract
2. Run Auctioneer Services (bid validator and auction server)
3. Configure your sequencer node to support Timeboost

### Step 1: Deploy the `ExpressLaneAuction` contract

First, clone the orbit-actions repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-actions.git
cd orbit-actions/scripts/foundry/timeboost
```

Create and edit the environment configuration file:

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

Configure the following parameters in your `.env` file:

```shell
## Configuration for DeployExpressLaneAuction.s.sol
PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS=                # Your proxy admin contract address
AUCTIONEER_ADDRESS=                 # Address that will send resolve auction requests
BIDDING_TOKEN_ADDRESS=              # Your ERC20 bid token address
BENEFICIARY_ADDRESS=                # Address to receive bid proceeds
AUCTIONEER_ADMIN_ADDRESS=           # Admin address for the auctioneer
MIN_RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADDRESS=   # Address allowed to set minimum reserve price
RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADDRESS=       # Address allowed to set reserve price
RESERVE_PRICE_SETTER_ADMIN_ADDRESS= # Admin for reserve price setter
BENEFICIARY_SETTER_ADDRESS=         # Address allowed to change beneficiary
ROUND_TIMING_SETTER_ADDRESS=        # Address allowed to adjust round timing
MASTER_ADMIN_ADDRESS=               # Master admin address

MIN_RESERVE_PRICE=0                 # Minimum price for bids (0 recommended for testing)

# Round timing configuration (in seconds)
ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS=60           # Total duration of each round
AUCTION_CLOSING_SECONDS=15          # Time before round end when new bids are closed
RESERVE_SUBMISSION_SECONDS=15       # Time allocated for reserve price submission
```

Deploy the contract:

```shell
forge script --sender $DEPLOYER --rpc-url $CHILD_CHAIN_RPC --slow ./DeployExpressLaneAuction.s.sol -vvv --verify --broadcast
# Use --account XXX / --private-key XXX / --interactive / --ledger to specify the transaction signer
```

Verify successful deployment by checking that the contract returns your configured bid token:

```shell
cast call --rpc-url=<Your-chain's-endpoint> <Your-ExpressLaneAuction-address> "biddingToken()(address)"
```

Example output:

```shell
0xYourBidTokenAddress
```

### Step 2: Run auctioneer services

There are two distinct services to run: the bid validator and the auction server. The bid validator verifies submitted bids, while the auction server sends the winning bid on-chain.

#### Prerequisites

The services require the `autonomous-auctioneer` binary, which is included in the Nitro Docker image. Alternatively, you can build it locally by following the [Build Nitro Locally](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/nitro/build-nitro-locally) guide.

To build only the `autonomous-auctioneer` component during the local build process:

```shell
make target/bin/autonomous-auctioneer
```

#### Running bid validator service

Start the bid validator with:

```shell
./autonomous-auctioneer \
--bid-validator.auction-contract-address=<Your ExpressLaneAuction address> \
--bid-validator.rpc-endpoint=<Your chain's rpc URL> \
--auctioneer-server.enable=false \
--bid-validator.redis-url=<Your Redis URL> \
--http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
--http.port=<port>
```

#### Running auction server service

Start the auction server with:

```shell
./autonomous-auctioneer \
--auctioneer-server.auction-contract-address=<Your ExpressLaneAuction address> \
--auctioneer-server.db-directory=<Your_auctioneer_server_db_directory> \
--auctioneer-server.redis-url=<Your Redis URL> \
--auctioneer-server.use-redis-coordinator=false \
--auctioneer-server.sequencer-endpoint=<Your sequencer URL> \
--auctioneer-server.wallet.private-key=<Your auctioneer private key> \
--bid-validator.enable=false
```

### Step 3: Configure your sequencer node for Timeboost

Update your sequencer node configuration to enable Timeboost functionality. Add the following new config to your sequencer's node configuration file:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "api": [
      // existing APIs
      "auctioneer",
      "timeboost"
    ]
  },
  "ws": {
    "api": [
      // existing APIs
      "auctioneer",
      "timeboost"
    ]
  },
  "execution": {
    "sequencer": {
      "timeboost": {
        "enable": true,
        "auction-contract-address": "<Your-ExpressLaneAuction-address>",
        "auctioneer-address": "<Your-auctioneer-address>",
        "redis-url": "<Your-Redis-URL>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Verifying your Timeboost setup

There are multiple ways to confirm that Timeboost is correctly enabled on your chain:

#### Periodic startup logs

When you start your sequencer with Timeboost enabled, you'll see periodic logs indicating the start of new express lane auction rounds:

```shell
New express lane auction round
```

This log indicates that the Timeboost mechanism is active and running normally.

#### Transaction processing confirmation

After finishing a bid request, look for messages in your sequencer logs such as:

```shell
AuctionResolved: New express lane controller assigned round
```

This message confirms that your sequencer is processing express queue transactions from the express lane controller, and that Timeboost is functioning correctly.

#### User interaction verification

Users can interact with Timeboost by submitting bids through the `auctioneer_submitBid` endpoint of your auctioneer service.
For detailed instructions on how users can interact with Timeboost, see [How to Use Timeboost](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/timeboost/how-to-use-timeboost).

A successful bid submission will trigger the auction resolution process and generate the corresponding logs mentioned above.

### Configuring Timeboost's Parameters

Below is a table of the configurable parameters and how to think about adjusting their values, should you choose to deploy and enable Timeboost for your chain.

| Parameter name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `roundDurationSeconds`  | Time during which the sequencer will honor the express lane privileges for transactions signed by the current round’s express lane controller. Default: 60 seconds                                                                                                                          | The larger this value, the more powerful and valuable controlling the express lane will be. Higher values may incentivize more participation and demand for the express lane time advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `auctionClosingSeconds` | Time before the start of the next round. The autonomous auctioneer will not accept bids during this time interval. Default: 15 seconds                                                                                                                                                      | The larger the value, the more difficult it is for participants to predict the value of the future express lane round, and therefore, their ability and confidence in being able to place an accurate/fair bid for the time advantage. However, a value that is too small may not allow the auctioneer sufficient time to resolve the auction on time during periods of high activity.                 |
| `beneficiary`           | An address where proceeds from the Timeboost auction are sent to when `flushBeneficiaryBalance()` gets called on the auction contract. Default: An address controlled by the chain's owner                                                                                                  | Can be any address, including the burn address, that the chain owner designates or controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `_biddingToken`         | Address of the token used to make bids in the Timeboost auction. It can be any `ERC-20` token, including the gas token of the network, provided the chosen token address does not have fee-on-transfer, rebasing, transfer hooks, or otherwise non-standard `ERC-20` logic. Default: `WETH` | This asset should ideally be liquid and easily obtainable for your auction participants. Furthermore, the less volatile this asset is, the more consistent your auction will be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `nonExpressDelayMsec`   | The artificial delay applied, by the sequencer, to the arrival timestamp on non-express lane transactions _before_ the non-express lane transactions eventually get sequenced. Default: 0.2 seconds, or 200 milliseconds                                                                    | The larger this value, the greater the time advantage will be for the express lane controller, making it easier for the express lane controller to capture MEV opportunities (e.g., backrunning, liquidations, or arbitrage) and therefore the more valuable. However, increasing this value comes at the expense of slower response times for user transactions in the non-express lane.              |
| `reservePrice`          | The minimum bid amount accepted by the auction contract for Timeboost auctions, denominated in `_biddingToken`. Default: None                                                                                                                                                               | This value should be left empty and only be changed to raise the minimum bid post-deployment of the auction contract (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `_minReservePrice`      | A value that must be equal to or below the `reservePrice` to act as a "floor price" for Timeboost bids. Enforced by the auction contract. Default: 0.001 `WETH`                                                                                                                             | A value that is low enough to make the auction worth while participating in, but not high enough to pose a significant barrier to entry (i.e. ideally, chain owners will want a fair, competitive market for the timeboost time advantage). This value can also be set high such that if someone does bid, the bid proceeds could offset some of the costs spent on running the autonomous auctioneer. |
