## Overview of the stack migration process

<VanillaAdmonition type="warning">

This document is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an end-to-end guide for executing the migration. Offchain Labs doesn’t have special knowledge or a private “fast path.” This document provides the extent of our guidance. Your current RaaS provider owns and executes the migration. We can provide [introductions to RaaSes](./third-party-integrations/third-party-providers#rollup-as-a-service-raas-providers).

</VanillaAdmonition>

### Why migrate to an Arbitrum chain?

Teams typically migrate when they need one or more of the following:

- **Lower fees**: Arbitrum chain Rollup or AnyTrust for low transaction fees.
- **Various customization options**: Custom gas token, flexible DA, Timeboost, BoLD, etc.
- **Mature tooling and ecosystem**: Bridges, indexers, wallets, monitoring, and partners with Arbitrum chain-ready integrations.

### Two migration paths

Teams coming from other stacks have two viable paths:

- **Ecosystem migration (simpler, faster)**: Launch a fresh Arbitrum chain. Users/app bridge funds and redeploy contracts. This approach is quicker and less risky, but it puts a burden on apps and users.
- **Chain-state migration (harder, slower)**: Transplant state/history so apps keep addresses and positions. This method requires more engineering, testing, and downtime planning.

The right choice depends on your user requirements, partner dependencies, and tolerance for downtime/engineering effort. Your RaaS owns and executes the migration plan.

### Can we keep the same chain ID?

Teams need to decide whether to use the old chain ID or a new one.

**Why this is relevant**: Wallets, explorers, and dApps assume that a given chain ID maps to a single, consistent history.

- If you keep the same chain ID, you should also preserve historical details: Every historical block/hash and RPC response for the pre-migration range must remain consistent after migration. If not, apps and analytics will break.
- If you’re going with a new chain ID, then you don’t need to preserve historical details. But you need to redirect users via UI, domains, and documentation.

### How should canonical bridges and token addresses be handled during migration?

Teams should determine the canonical bridge for each asset and the authoritative token addresses before the handover. This decision is important because confusion here could cause liquidity fragmentation and cause users to bridge the “wrong” way.

**Recommended actions**:

- Publish an official asset list (symbols, decimals, canonical token address, and canonical bridge) before migration.
- Enforce a one-way migration from the legacy chain to the new Arbitrum chain (freeze legacy deposits while allowing Arbitrum chain deposits).
- Coordinate with third-party bridges/routers to repoint routes.
- Deprecate legacy wrappers where needed and communicate exact swap/burn/mint paths.

### How do we preserve data & historical queries?

**Problem**: After migration, historical data remains on the old stack, while new data resides on the Arbitrum chain.

**Why it matters**: Apps, analytics, and explorers often read historical events. If they must re-integrate two endpoints, things will break.

**Recommended action**: Run a dual-RPC gateway that:

- Route pre-migration block range to an archive node on the old stack, and
- Route post-migration requests to the new Arbitrum chain. Apps can continue to use a single RPC URL and don’t need to be aware of the boundary.

### How can we migrate without downtime on my chain?

True, zero-downtime is not realistic for a Rollup stack migration; however, you can minimize downtime that impacts users.

### How long is the downtime for chain-state migration?

Expect a freeze window of hours for snapshot integrity. The full project timeline is often set aside 4-8 weeks, including partner cutovers and audits.

:::warning Important

Pause withdrawals earlier than the main freeze window to ensure no funds get trapped in in-flight bridges (i.e., deposits paused at the start of the freeze and withdrawals paused earlier, as per bridge requirements).

:::

### How can we migrate without losing state? Ideally, we would like to keep the full state

You can use the chain-state migration process. The two common approaches are:

- State replay: Re-execute legacy blocks into the Arbitrum chain. This process can be heavy, but it can preserve more historical information. **Caution**: If the legacy stack has different opcode semantics, precompiles, or system contracts, replay can diverge, resulting in a different end state even with identical transactions. Validate equivalence early on a private testnet before committing.
- Genesis import: Export balances/storage and pre-seed them in the chain’s genesis. This process is lighter and can preserve the state at a chosen block.

### How can I migrate without affecting my Apps/ecosystem on my chain?

Minimize surface changes and abstract the rest. Keep external interfaces stable:

- Chain ID: Only if you can preserve historical details, otherwise choose a new chain ID
- A consistent RPC URL via a dual-RPC gateway
- Contract addresses via replay/genesis pre-allocation
- Canonical assets/bridges.

Coordinate early with wallets, indexers, bridges, and oracles to repoint routes and allow-lists.

### What breaks with zk-specific features?

Zero knowledge (zk) pre-compiles don’t carry over. Port logic to Solidity or Stylus or remove/replace functionality. Please check with your RaaS regarding this matter.

#### What is the process for migrating an existing chain on a different stack to Arbitrum chain?

On a high level, there are two paths for migration:

- **Ecosystem migration:** Simplifies the chain operator experience by placing the burden on users and apps to self-migrate their assets and contracts to a new chain deployment.
- **Chain state migration:** A more complex migration where the chain state gets transplanted into the new Rollup stack/contract system, but the ecosystem and user experience may stay relatively the same.

The rest of this answer assumes that the team wants to perform the latter. For chain-state migration, the overall process for chain-state migration from another optimistic stack chain is:

#### Contracts Migration:

1. Moving escrowed funds from the previous Rollup bridge into an Arbitrum chain bridge

#### Node Migration & Set Up:

1. Freeze legacy chain writes and make RPC read-only:
   1. Stop the legacy chain’s proposer/sequencer so no new blocks or transactions get created after the chosen upgrade block.
   2. Configure the legacy RPC to reject write methods (e.g., `eth_sendRawTransaction`) and only serve readable requests for historical data.
2. Ensure that you can export required state from your EVM-compatible client at the upgrade block.
3. Expect a freeze window of hours (depends on state size) for snapshot integrity.
4. Run Nitro nodes for post-migration traffic.
5. Run a legacy archive node in parallel. This archive node wouldn’t try to advance beyond the upgrade block.
6. Put a dual-RPC gateway in front that routes pre-migration ranges to the legacy archive node and post-migration ranges to Nitro, so apps keep a single RPC URL.

The only example of a chain that has done this is Powerloom, and they have also [documented this in their records](https://docs.powerloom.io/category/chain-migration/).

### Is there a checklist that we can follow?

Here is a rough outline of the tasks you need to complete to ensure a smooth cutover, assuming you have a 30-day lead time before the chain migration. Consult your RaaS provider for the most accurate guidance, as the checklist may not cover every detail.

#### 2 months before → 4 weeks before migration: planning and thinking

- [ ] Choose migration path
- [ ] Select Arbitrum chain mode: Rollup (Ethereum DA) vs. AnyTrust (DA committee)
- [ ] Chain ID strategy: keep or change.

#### 4 weeks before → 3 weeks before migration: alignment

- [ ] Open partner threads: Bridges, oracles, indexers, wallets, explorers, etc.
- [ ] Publish migration documents (internal/external), asking for input/comments with rationale, rough dates, and contact points.

#### 3 weeks before → 2 weeks before migration: build and test

- [ ] RaaS: set up private Arbitrum chain
- [ ] Testnet deployment: Sequencer, batch poster, staker, DA config.
- [ ] Inventory contracts & state: Addresses, precompiles, proxies, admin keys, governance
- [ ] Stand up Dual-RPC gateway prototype: Route pre-migration range to old stack archive; post-migration to Arbitrum chain.
- [ ] Prepare official asset list: Canonical bridge(s), authoritative token addresses, symbols, decimals.
- [ ] Set up monitoring & alerts: Retryables, batches, assertions, DAC liveness.

#### 2 weeks before → 1 week before: cutover preparation

- [ ] Announce freeze windows: Date/time, what pauses, expected downtime.
- [ ] Lower DNS TTLs for RPC/explorer, provision new SSL certificates.
- [ ] Partners confirm readiness.
- [ ] Conduct a final dry run with canary transactions/batches in staging and document the process.

#### 1 day before starting new chain:

- [ ] Pause new deposits on legacy chain; keep withdrawals open if safe.

#### The day of launching the new chain:

- [ ] Stop old chain block/transaction production: disable proposer/sequencer, set legacy RPC to read-only, block `eth_sendRawTransaction` method, thus no new blocks or transactions.
- [ ] Take a snapshot or confirm the last block for state replay
- [ ] Bring up the new Arbitrum chain mainnet: import state or launch genesis.
- [ ] Start batch poster/staker and verify assertions on L1.
- [ ] Flip DNS for RPC/explorer; enable dual-RPC gateway for historical queries
- [ ] Open canonical bridges and publish asset list
- [ ] Make announcements after all health checks clear and partner confirmations pass.

#### 1 day after launch → 1 week after launch: harden and handoff

- [ ] Watch retryables/batches/assertions and base-fee curve
- [ ] Confirm indexer backfills and wallet chain-add UX
- [ ] Incentivize any remaining users/apps to move: if ecosystem path.
- [ ] Decommission legacy infrastructure after ≥ 72 hours of stable activity.
