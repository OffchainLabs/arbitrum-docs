The embedded <a data-quicklook-from="bridge">Bridge</a> is available to all builders in the <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a> ecosystem, whether that be an application on <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> or an application on an <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-chain">Arbitrum chain</a>. The integration of the embedded bridge enables a universal, Arbitrum-native experience for onboarding users’ assets from other chains. Note that the embedded bridge does not currently support mobile experiences.

Developers can embed the widget onto their webpage using a simple iframe and configure colors and window sizing by modifying the iframe code. Transactions are routed to the [Li.fi](http://Li.fi)’s API, which then requests quotes from various third-party bridging providers, such as Layer Zero, Across, or Relay. The fastest and cheapest paths are highlighted to users based on the quotes. The user may pick their preferred bridging option.

**Functionality**

**Core functionality:**

- Deposits from Base, Ethereum Mainnet, and other <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-chains">Arbitrum Chains</a>
- Withdrawals to Arbitrum One or other Arbitrum chains
- Configuration of supported chains for both deposits and withdrawals
- <a data-quicklook-from="batch">Batch</a> transactions
- Long-tail assets on supported bridges/DEXes if liquidity is available
- Fiat on ramps via Moonpay (more providers coming soon\!)
- Swaps (coming soon)

**Visual features:**

- Normal mode, widget mode
- Layout options
- Visual customization

**Future functionality:**

- Swaps
- Fiat onramping
- More chain/token support

**Arbitrum bridge playground**  
Developers can experiment with Arbitrum Bridge configurations in real-time using the bridge playground. This interactive tool allows developers to:

- Test different modes: Switch between normal and widget modes to see how they differ
- Configure feature flags: Toggle network selection and batch transfers to understand their impact
- Explore layout options: Try vertical and horizontal layouts for the widget interface
- Generate embed code: Get ready-to-use iframe code for an integration
- See live preview: Watch changes reflect immediately in the embedded bridge interface

### **Integration details**

The widget uses an `iframe` under the hood, enabling easy integrations for any frontend. Visit the bridge playground page to generate `iframe` code with configured features.

**Support**

Before integrating, developers should review the current chain offerings to ensure that their desired routes are shown. The embedded bridge utilizes [Li.fi’](https://docs.li.fi/api-reference/fetch-all-known-tokens)s token lists to populate supported routes and quotes. If a developer plans to utilize the on-ramp functionality, please notify [partnerships@offchainlabs.com](mailto:partnerships@offchainlabs.com) to facilitate seamless support.

Developers should contact [partnerships@offchainlabs.com](mailto:partnerships@offchainlabs.com) to discuss specific chain and token support.

For <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">Transaction</a> support, users should create a [ticket](https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new) with the Arbitrum Foundation and select the “Widget” option in the dropdown.

**Chain and bridge support**

The embedded bridge currently supports Arbitrum One, Base, Ethereum Mainnet, Ape Chain, and Superposition.

**FAQs**

1. If I’m an application on Arbitrum One (or an Arbitrum chain), what do I need to do to adopt?

Apps can adopt permissionlessly if their chain is already supported. If a chain is already supported, app developers should visit the playground and accept the developer terms of service to generate code for the embedded bridge. To receive a link to the playground, contact partnerships@offchainlabs.com.

2. If I’m an Orbit chain and I want support, how do I adopt?

An integration with LiFi and a minimum number of bridges are needed to enable a good experience. Contact [partnerships@offchainlabs.com](mailto:partnerships@offchainlabs.com) to discuss adding support for a chain.

3. Are there any fees associated with the embedded bridge?

The embedded bridge routes orders through Lifi’s route aggregator, which charges a 15bp fee on all transactions.
