import ImageZoom from '@site/src/components/ImageZoom';

This quickstart is for users who want to deposit `ETH` or any `ERC-20` tokens from a <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">parent chain</a> to a <a data-quicklook-from="child-chain">child chain</a> or vice versa, using [Arbitrum’s bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). For example, from Ethereum to <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a>, or from Arbitrum One to a Layer 3 Arbitrum chain.

We will walk you through the entire process step by step, providing as much detail as possible. If you feel stuck at any step, don’t hesitate to contact us through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/arbitrum), and we will be happy to help you complete the process.

The only prerequisite for this quickstart is to have a Web3 <a data-quicklook-from="wallet">wallet</a> installed, such as MetaMask or OKX Wallet. If you don’t have one installed, visit the [Arbitrum portal](https://portal.arbitrum.io/?categories=wallet) for a list of available wallets to download.

## Deposit `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens (from parent chain to child chain)

### Step 1: Get some native currency

You’ll need the native currency of the parent chain to bridge your assets to the destination chain. For example, if you want to bridge assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum One, you’ll need `ETH` on Ethereum to initiate the process.

There are several ways to obtain the native currency:

- Using a [supported centralized exchange](https://portal.arbitrum.io/projects?chains=arbitrum-one_arbitrum-nova&subcategories=centralized-exchanges), which allows you to purchase `ETH` and withdraw it to your wallet. Most major centralized exchanges support direct withdrawals from your centralized exchange wallet to the Arbitrum network.
- Using an [on-ramp service](https://portal.arbitrum.io/projects?chains=arbitrum-one_arbitrum-nova&subcategories=fiat-on-ramp), which allows you to purchase `ETH` and send it directly to your wallet.
- If you are using a testnet, request funds from a Sepolia or Arbitrum Sepolia [faucet](../for-devs/dev-tools-and-resources/chain-info#faucet-list).

### Step 2: Add the preferred network to your wallet

You'll also need to add the desired chain's RPC endpoint to your wallet. Here, we provide an example of how to do this using MetaMask; however, the process should be relatively similar to any other wallet.

1. First, click the MetaMask extension in your browser.
2. Click the network selector drop-down in the top-right corner.
3. Click the **Add a custom network** and then provide the information corresponding to the chain you want to send your assets to (see below).

Below are the the most common Arbitrum chains. For a more exhaustive list, please visit our [RPC endpoints and providers](/build-decentralized-apps/reference/01-node-providers.mdx) page.

| Parameter          | Arbitrum One                 | <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a> | Arbitrum Sepolia (testnet)             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Network name       | Arbitrum One                 | Arbitrum Nova                                            | Arbitrum Sepolia                       |
| RPC URL            | https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc | https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc                             | https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc |
| Chain ID           | 42161                        | 42170                                                    | 421614                                 |

| Block explorer URL | https://arbiscan.io          | https://nova.arbiscan.io/                                | https://sepolia.arbiscan.io            |

### Step 3: Initiate the deposit

To bridge your `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens to a different chain, start by visitng [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

1. Connect your wallet to the bridge.
2. Ensure the **source** network is selected (from where you want to deposit your assets) at the top of the page.
3. Select the **destination** network (where you want your assets to go), e.g., Arbitrum One.

:::caution

Note that testnets like Arbitrum Sepolia only appear if you have an established connection to the appropriate parent testnet network (Ethereum Sepolia).

Also note, that when choosing the **source** or **destination** network, a pop up will appear where you can make your selection (illustrated below).

4. Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu.

  alt="Select the token to bridge"

5. Enter the amount of `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens you want to bridge over in the **From** box.
6. Press **Move** funds.
7. Follow the additional prompts from your Web3 wallet.

:::info Ensure sufficient `ETH` balance

Please ensure you have sufficient `ETH` in your wallet to cover the transation costs; otherwise, the Web3 wallet pop-up will not appear.

:::

<ImageZoom

  alt="Enter the amount of tokens to bridge"
  className="img-600px"
/>

After you submit the <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> through your Web3 wallet, you can expect your funds to arrive on the destination chain within roughly 15-30 minutes (depending on chain congestion).

Also, ensure your wallet is set to the destination network so you can see when your funds arrive.

## Withdraw `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens (from child chain to parent chain)

:::info Seven day withdrawal period for Arbitrum One and Nova networks

Once you withdraw your funds from Arbitrum One or Nova through the Arbitrum bridge, you will have to wait for at least seven days to receive them on the Ethereum mainnet. For more details, see [Arbitrum Bridge: Troubleshooting](/arbitrum-bridge/03-troubleshooting.mdx#how-long-does-it-take-before-i-receive-my-funds-when-i-initiate-a-withdrawal-from-arbitrum-chains-one-and-nova).

:::

To bridge your funds back to the parent chain, you must be connected to the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) with your wallet and ensure you establish a connection to the source network (from which you want to withdraw assets) at the top of the page. Then, select the destination network (where you want your assets to go), e.g., Ethereum mainnet.

:::caution

Testnets like Arbitrum Sepolia only appear if you have an established connection to the appropriate parent testnet network (Ethereum Sepolia).

:::

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/arb-bridge-getting-started-users-7.png"
  alt="Select the token to withdraw"
  className="img-600px"

1. Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu.
2. Enter the amount of `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens you want to bridge in the **From** box.
3. Press **Move funds**.
4. Follow the prompts from your Web3 wallet.

:::info Ensure sufficient `ETH` balance

Please ensure you have sufficient `ETH` in your wallet to cover the transaction costs; otherwise, no Web3 wallet pop-up will appear.

:::

<ImageZoom

  alt="Enter the amount of token to withdraw"
  className="img-600px"

A countdown will appear stating that you'll receive your funds in 7-8 days.

You can check the status of your withdrawal by clicking on your profile in the top-right corner and opening the **Transactions** tab, where you can claim it when it's ready.

<ImageZoom

Once the countdown is complete, switch to the destination network in your wallet and press the **Claim** button, which is now blue, to receive your funds.
