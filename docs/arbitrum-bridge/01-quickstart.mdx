import ImageZoom from '@site/src/components/ImageZoom';

This quickstart is for users who want to deposit `ETH` or any `ERC-20` tokens from a <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">Parent chain</a> to a <a data-quicklook-from="child-chain">Child chain</a> or vice versa, using [Arbitrum's bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). For example, from Ethereum to Arbitrum One, or from <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> to a Layer 3 Arbitrum chain.

We will walk you through the entire process step by step, providing as much detail as possible. If you feel stuck at any step, don't hesitate to contact us through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/arbitrum), and we will be happy to help you complete the process.

The only prerequisite for this quickstart is to have a Web3 <a data-quicklook-from="wallet">Wallet</a> installed, such as MetaMask or OKX Wallet. If you don't have one installed, visit the [Arbitrum's portal](https://portal.arbitrum.io/?categories=wallet) for a list of wallets to choose from to download.

## Deposit `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens (from parent chain to child chain)

### Step 1: Get some native currency

You'll need the native currency of the parent chain to bridge your assets to the destination chain. For example, if you want to bridge assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum One, you'll need `ETH` on Ethereum to initiate the process.

There are several ways to obtain the native currency:

- Using a [supported centralized exchange](https://portal.arbitrum.io/projects?chains=arbitrum-one_arbitrum-nova&subcategories=centralized-exchanges), which allows you to purchase `ETH` and withdraw it to your wallet. Most major centralized exchanges support direct withdrawals from your centralized exchange wallet to Arbitrum.
- Using an [on-ramp service](https://portal.arbitrum.io/projects?chains=arbitrum-one_arbitrum-nova&subcategories=fiat-on-ramp), which allows you to purchase `ETH` and send it directly to your wallet.
- If you are using a testnet, request funds from a faucet for [Sepolia](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) or [Arbitrum Sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia).

### Step 2: Add the preferred network to your wallet

You'll also need to add the desired chain's RPC endpoint to your wallet. Here, we provide an example of how to do this using MetaMask/OKX Wallet; however, the process should be similar for any other wallet.

1. You need to first click on the MetaMask/OKX Wallet extension in your browser.
2. Click the network selector drop-down in the top-left corner.
3. Click the **Add Network** button at the bottom.
4. Click **Add a network manually** and then provide information corresponding to the chain you want to send your assets to.

| Parameter          | Arbitrum One                 | <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a> | Arbitrum Sepolia (testnet)             |

| RPC URL            | https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc | https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc                             | https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc |

### Step 3: Initiate the deposit

To bridge your `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens to a different chain, start by visitng [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

1. Log in to the bridge with your wallet.
2. Ensure (or choose) the **source** network is selected (from where you want to deposit your assets) at the top of the page.
3. Select the **destination** network (where you want your assets to go), e.g., Arbitrum One.

:::caution

Note that testnets like Arbitrum Sepolia only appear if you have an established connection to the appropriate parent testnet network (Ethereum Sepolia).

4. Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu. You can also enable/disable the token lists by clicking the **Manage token lists** button on the bottom-right corner of the drop-down menu.

<ImageZoom

5. Enter the amount of `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens you want to bridge over in the **From** box.
6. Press **Move** funds.
7. Follow the additional prompts from your Web3 wallet.

:::info Ensure sufficient `ETH` balance

Please ensure you have sufficient `ETH` in your wallet to cover the transation costs; otherwise, the Web3 wallet pop-up will not appear.

:::

<ImageZoom

  alt="Enter the amount of tokens to bridge"
  className="img-800px"
/>

After you submit the <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">Transaction</a> through your Web3 wallet, you can expect your funds to arrive on the destination chain within roughly 15-30 minutes (depending on the chain congestion).

Also, ensure your wallet is set to the destination chain so you can see when your funds arrive.

## Withdraw `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens (from child chain to parent chain)

:::info Seven day withdrawal period for Arbitrum One and Nova networks

Once you withdraw your funds from Arbitrum One or Nova through the Arbitrum bridge, you will have to wait for at least seven days to receive them on the Ethereum mainnet. For more details, see [Arbitrum Bridge: Troubleshooting](/arbitrum-bridge/03-troubleshooting.mdx#how-long-does-it-take-before-i-receive-my-funds-when-i-initiate-a-withdrawal-from-arbitrum-chains-one-and-nova).

:::

To bridge your funds back to the parent chain, you must be logged in to the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) with your wallet and ensure you establish a connection to the source network (from which you want to withdraw assets) at the top of the page. Then, select the destination network (where you want your assets to go), e.g., Ethereum mainnet.

:::caution

Testnets like Arbitrum Sepolia only appear if you have an established connection to the appropriate parent testnet network (Ethereum Sepolia).

<ImageZoom

1. Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu. You can also enable/disable the token lists by clicking the **Manage** token lists button in the bottom-right corner of the drop-down menu.
2. Enter the amount of `ETH` or `ERC-20` tokens you want to bridge in the **From** box.
3. Press **Move funds**.
4. Follow the prompts from your Web3 wallet.

:::info Ensure sufficient `ETH` balance

Please ensure you have sufficient `ETH` in your wallet to cover the transaction costs; otherwise, no Web3 wallet pop-up will appear.

A countdown will pop-up stating that you'll receive your funds in 7-8 days.

You can check the status of your withdrawal by clicking on your profile in the top-right corner and opening the **Transactions** tab, where you can claim it when it's ready.

<ImageZoom

Once the countdown is complete, switch to the destination network on your wallet and press the **Claim** button, which has now turned blue, to receive your funds.
