This section provides an in-depth overview of the features provided by the [Stylus Rust SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs). For information about deploying Rust smart contracts, see the `cargo stylus` [CLI Tool](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus). For a conceptual introduction to Stylus, see [Stylus: A Gentle Introduction](../gentle-introduction.mdx). To deploy your first Stylus smart contract using Rust, refer to the [Quickstart](../quickstart.mdx).

The Stylus Rust SDK is built on top of [Alloy](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/alloy), a collection of crates empowering the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Because the SDK uses the same [Rust primitives for Ethereum types](https://docs.rs/alloy-primitives/latest/alloy_primitives/), Stylus is compatible with existing Rust libraries.

The Stylus Rust SDK has been audited in August 2024 at [commit #62bd831](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/tree/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06) by Open Zeppelin which can be viewed [on our audits page](../../audit-reports.mdx).
