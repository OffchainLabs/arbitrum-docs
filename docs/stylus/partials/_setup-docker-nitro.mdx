### Installing Docker for local testing

The Nitro devnode (and Docker) lets you spin up a local devnet to test your contracts before deploying them to an actual network. This gives you a fast feedback loop without spending testnet funds.

Running a Nitro devnode also solves the issue of having tokens to deploy and execute contracts, as the devchain gives you pre-funded accounts.

**macOS:**

Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

**Linux:**

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

**Windows:**

Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (requires WSL2).

**Start Nitro devnode:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-devnode.git
cd nitro-devnode
./run-dev-node.sh
```

**Verify:**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8547 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```
