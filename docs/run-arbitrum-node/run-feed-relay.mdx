:::caution

If running a single node, there is no need to run a feed relay. When running more than one node, it is strongly recommended to run a single feed relay per data center, which will reduce ingress fees and improve stability.

Feed endpoints will soon require compression with a custom dictionary, so if connecting to a feed with anything other than a standard node, it is strongly suggested to run a local feed relay, which will provide an uncompressed feed by default.

:::

:::info Websocket connection stability

Websocket connections to feed endpoints may occasionally be reset by infrastructure providers. The feed client in the relay automatically restarts immediately on disconnect. For most users, a delay of several blocks is not noticeable.

For latency-sensitive applications, you can configure a redundant feed connection at the relay level by providing multiple comma-separated URLs to the same endpoint:

```shell
--node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed,wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
```

**Important considerations:**

- This doubles the bandwidth usage at the relay
- Excessive connections to feed endpoints may be rate-limited
- This redundancy should be implemented at the relay level, not at individual nodes
- Generally not recommended unless your application specifically requires minimal latency
- Do not use more than one redundant feed connection

:::

The feed relay is in the same Docker image as the Nitro node.

- Here is an example of how to run the feed relay for Arbitrum One:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.7.2-42be4fe@@ --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1-feed.arbitrum.io/feed --chain.id=42161
  ```
- Here is an example of how to run nitro-node for Arbitrum One with a custom relay:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 @@latestNitroNodeImage=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.7.2-42be4fe@@ --parent-chain.connection.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --chain.id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642
  ```

Note that Arbitrum Classic does not communicate with Nitro sequencer, so classic relay is no longer used.

## Helm charts (Kubernetes)

If you are using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to run your feed relay, a helm chart is available at [ArtifactHUB](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/offchainlabshelm/relay). It supports running a Nitro relay by providing the feed input URL. Find more information in the [OCL community Helm charts repository](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/community-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/relay).
