Layer 2 network operators must connect to an Ethereum beacon chain node with historical blob data to ensure proper functioning of the Nitro node software, or risk failure in fetching blob data.

## Impacted audiences

Required action will be required from: RPC nodes, Arbitrum One / Nova node operators, Arbitrum chain node operators

#### If you run a Nitro node and use an external L1 Ethereum beacon chain RPC URL

- Confirm that your external L1 beacon chain RPC provider has configured their L1 beacon chain node to subscribe to all subnets.

#### If your external L1 beacon chain RPC doesn't subscribe to all subnets:

- Switch to a provider that does.

#### If you run a Nitro node and operate your own L1 Ethereum beacon chain node:

- Add the new flag (refer to [specific client flags](#specific-client-flags)) to your beacon node's configuration.

:::info Note

Ensure that the external L1 beacon chain RPC provider you're using subscribes to all subnets.

## L1 beacon chain node flags

### Prysm Consensus Layer clients

Prysm nodes have a new beacon node flag `--subscribe-all-data-subnets` that needs to be added to P2P options. Refer to the [Prysm command-line options documentation](https://prysm.offchainlabs.com/docs/configure-prysm/parameters/) for configuration details.

This flag is available as of Prysm v6.1.0. We recommend upgrading to the [latest stable Prysm releases](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/releases) to ensure you have the most recent features and security updates.

### Other Consensus Layer clients

Other Consensus Layer nodes also have flags to ensure they sync data from across all subnets.

:::warning Verification

The Offchain Labs team hasn't verified the accuracy of the flags below, including the corresponding versions that support these flags. Consult the respective release notes and documentation for non-Prysm consensus layer clients to ensure you're adding the correct flags.

:::

### Specific client flags

:::note Sepolia only

Currently, the following clients are supported for Sepolia only.

<!-- Import client-flags partial -->

import ClientFlagsTable from '../partials/_client-flags.mdx';

<ClientFlagsTable />

## Checklist

To maintain uninterrupted node operation and blob availability:

- Add the appropriate flag for your consensus layer client.
- Verify your Sepolia beacon endpoint’s configuration.
- Verify your Mainnet beacon endpoint’s configuration.
