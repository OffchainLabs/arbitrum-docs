<a data-quicklook-from="arbos">ArbOS</a> 51 is still pre-release. This document may change.

</VanillaAdmonition>

This page is intended for all Arbitrum node operators and Arbitrum chain owners chains. This page summarizes the changes brought by ArbOS 51, and what you should do to ensure a seamless upgrade.

<VanillaAdmonition type="warning" title="Action Required">

Before Ethereum <a data-quicklook-from="parent-chain">Parent chain</a> Sepolia and Mainnet upgrade to Fusaka: ensure that your Nitro node version is upgraded and consensus layer client is configured as per the [Fusaka upgrade notice](../../notices/fusaka-upgrade-notice.mdx).

</VanillaAdmonition>
The minimum Nitro version that supports ArbOS 51 is [Nitro v3.9.3](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.9.3), which is available on Docker Hub with the image tag `Noffchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.9.0-cca645a`. This release of Nitro is a mandatory upgrade for <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> and <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Nova</a> node operators if adopted. For Arbitrum One and Nova, the ArbOS 51 upgrade will require a governance vote to activate.

As a refresher, ArbOS upgrades get treated as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hard fork. To learn more, refer to the [Arbitrum ArbOS upgrades forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695). Note that ArbOS 50 is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS 40 Callisto](./arbos40.mdx).
