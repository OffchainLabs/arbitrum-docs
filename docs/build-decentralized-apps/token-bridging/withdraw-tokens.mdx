This guide shows you how to withdraw ERC-20 tokens from an Arbitrum child chain back to a parent chain (like Ethereum). This assumes your token is already configured for bridging. If you need to set up bridging for a new token, see [Configure token bridging](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/configure-token-bridging/setup-standard-gateway.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- Your token must already be bridgeable (registered with a gateway)
- A wallet with tokens on the child chain
- ETH on both chains (child chain for initiation, parent chain for final execution)
- **Important**: Withdrawals require ~7 days to finalize due to the challenge period
- Familiarity with [child-to-parent messaging](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/l2-to-l1-messaging.mdx)

## Withdrawing tokens using the Arbitrum SDK

The simplest way to withdraw tokens is using the [Arbitrum SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk):

### Step 1: Initiate withdrawal on child chain

```javascript
import { getArbitrumNetwork, Erc20Bridger } from '@arbitrum/sdk';
import { providers, Wallet } from 'ethers';

// Set up providers and wallet
const parentProvider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.PARENT_RPC);
const childProvider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.CHILD_RPC);
const childWallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, childProvider);

// Initialize the bridge
const childNetwork = await getArbitrumNetwork(childProvider);
const erc20Bridge = new Erc20Bridger(childNetwork);

// Initiate withdrawal
const withdrawTx = await erc20Bridge.withdraw({
  amount: ethers.utils.parseUnits('100', 18),
  erc20ParentAddress: parentTokenAddress,
  childSigner: childWallet,
});

const withdrawReceipt = await withdrawTx.wait();
console.log(`Withdrawal initiated: ${withdrawReceipt.transactionHash}`);
```

### Step 2: Wait for the challenge period (~7 days)

```javascript
import { L2ToL1MessageStatus } from '@arbitrum/sdk';

// Get the withdrawal message
const childReceipt = new L2TransactionReceipt(withdrawReceipt);
const messages = await childReceipt.getL2ToL1Messages(childWallet);
const message = messages[0];

// Wait for the message to be confirmed (takes ~7 days)
await message.waitUntilReadyToExecute(childProvider);
console.log('Message confirmed! Ready to execute on parent chain.');
```

### Step 3: Execute on parent chain

```javascript
// Execute the withdrawal on the parent chain
const parentWallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, parentProvider);
const executeResult = await message.execute(childProvider);
await executeResult.wait();

console.log('Withdrawal complete!');
console.log(`Parent chain transaction: ${executeResult.transactionHash}`);
```

## Withdrawing tokens manually

If you prefer to interact with the contracts directly:

### Step 1: Initiate withdrawal on child chain

Approve and call the L2GatewayRouter:

```javascript
// Approve the L2 gateway
const childToken = new ethers.Contract(childTokenAddress, erc20ABI, childWallet);
const childRouter = new ethers.Contract(childRouterAddress, routerABI, childWallet);

// Get the gateway address
const gateway = await childRouter.getGateway(parentTokenAddress);

// Approve
await childToken.approve(gateway, amountToWithdraw);

// Initiate withdrawal
const withdrawTx = await childRouter.outboundTransfer(
  parentTokenAddress, // Parent chain token address
  parentDestination, // Where to send tokens on parent chain
  amountToWithdraw,
  '0x', // Extra data (usually empty)
);

await withdrawTx.wait();
```

### Step 2: Wait for challenge period

After initiating the withdrawal, you must wait approximately 7 days for the assertion containing your withdrawal to be confirmed.

You can check the status on the [Arbitrum Bridge UI](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) by connecting your wallet, or programmatically track the message status.

### Step 3: Construct proof and execute on parent chain

After the challenge period, get the proof data using `NodeInterface`:

```javascript
const nodeInterface = new ethers.Contract(
  '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8',
  nodeInterfaceABI,
  childProvider,
);

// Get proof data (you'll need the batch number and index from the withdrawal receipt)
const proofData = await nodeInterface.constructOutboxProof(batchNumber, indexInBatch);
```

Then execute on the parent chain using the Outbox contract:

```javascript
const outbox = new ethers.Contract(outboxAddress, outboxABI, parentWallet);

const executeTx = await outbox.executeTransaction(
  proofData.proof,
  proofData.path,
  proofData.l2Sender,
  proofData.l1Dest,
  proofData.l2Block,
  proofData.l1Block,
  proofData.timestamp,
  proofData.amount,
  proofData.calldataForL1,
);

await executeTx.wait();
console.log('Withdrawal executed on parent chain!');
```

## How withdrawals work

The token withdrawal process:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/apps-bridge_withdrawals.png"
  alt="Withdrawal process using the gateway"
  className="img-800px"
/>

1. **Child chain**: Tokens are burned (or escrowed for custom tokens)
2. **Message created**: A child-to-parent message is encoded and included in an assertion
3. **Challenge period**: Wait ~7 days for the assertion to be confirmed
4. **Parent chain**: After confirmation, execute the message to release tokens from the parent gateway

For more details on the underlying protocol, see:

- [Child to parent chain messaging](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/l2-to-l1-messaging.mdx)
- [Token bridging overview](/how-arbitrum-works/token-bridging/overview.mdx)

## Troubleshooting

### "Withdrawal not ready to execute"

The challenge period hasn't passed yet. Withdrawals take approximately 7 days (6.4 days on Arbitrum One) to finalize. Check the status using:

```javascript
const status = await message.status(childProvider);
console.log(L2ToL1MessageStatus[status]); // Should show "CONFIRMED" when ready
```

### "Message already executed"

This withdrawal has already been executed. Check the parent chain token balance - the tokens should already be there.

### Finding batch number and index

If you need to manually construct the proof, you can find the batch number and index from the withdrawal transaction receipt events. Look for the `L2ToL1Tx` event emitted by `ArbSys`.
