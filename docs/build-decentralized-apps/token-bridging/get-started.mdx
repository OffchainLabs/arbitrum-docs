Token bridging is a fundamental aspect of any child chain protocol. It allows projects to quickly integrate with the Arbitrum ecosystem by leveraging their existing parent chain tokens.

## I want to deposit or withdraw tokens

If your token is already configured for bridging, use these guides:

- **[Deposit tokens](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/deposit-tokens.mdx)**: Move tokens from parent chain to child chain
- **[Withdraw tokens](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/withdraw-tokens.mdx)**: Move tokens from child chain back to parent chain

These guides work for any token that's already bridgeable, regardless of which gateway type was configured.

## I want to make my token bridgeable

If you're setting up bridging for a new token, you have three gateway options to choose from:

### 1. Standard gateway (recommended for most tokens)

Use the [standard gateway](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/configure-token-bridging/setup-standard-gateway.mdx) if you want:

- Automatic deployment of a standard ERC-20 token on Arbitrum
- No pre-configuration required
- The simplest setup process

For additional information, see [standard ERC-20 gateway](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/token-bridging.mdx#default-standard-bridging) in the conceptual docs.

### 2. Generic-custom gateway (for custom token logic)

Use the [generic-custom gateway](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/configure-token-bridging/setup-generic-custom-gateway.mdx) if you need:

- Custom functionality in your child chain token
- Control over the child chain token implementation
- Additional features beyond standard ERC-20

For additional information, see [Arbitrum generic custom gateway](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/token-bridging.mdx#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway) in the conceptual docs.

### 3. Custom gateway (for advanced use cases)

Use a [custom gateway](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/configure-token-bridging/setup-custom-gateway.mdx) if you need:

- Specialized gateway logic beyond what standard gateways provide
- Custom handling of deposits and withdrawals
- Advanced features like child chain-minted tokens being withdrawable to parent chain

For additional information, see [other types of gateways](/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/token-bridging.mdx#other-flavors-of-gateways) in the conceptual docs.
