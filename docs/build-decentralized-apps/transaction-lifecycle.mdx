You can submit transactions to the <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum">Arbitrum</a> chain through two main pathways:

1. **Through the <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer">Sequencer</a>** - The standard method for most transactions
2. **Bypassing the Sequencer** - Using the <a data-quicklook-from="delayed-inbox">Delayed Inbox</a> contract on the Parent chain

This guide explains both methods, when to use each one, and how they work within Arbitrum's <a data-quicklook-from="transaction">transaction</a> lifecycle.

## Transaction submission methods

### Sequencer pathways

You can send transactions to the Sequencer through four methods:

- Public RPC endpoints
- Third-party RPC providers
- Self-hosted Arbitrum nodes
- Direct Sequencer endpoint

The first three options route through a load balancer, while the Sequencer endpoint connects directly.

### Non-sequencer pathway

You can also submit transactions directly to the Delayed Inbox contract on the Parent chain. This method works even when the Sequencer is unavailable and provides additional censorship resistance.

The following diagram shows the different ways you can submit transactions to Arbitrum:

## Submitting transactions to the Sequencer

The Sequencer processes most transactions on Arbitrum. You have four options for sending transactions to the Sequencer, each with different benefits depending on your needs.

### Public RPC

Arbitrum provides public RPC endpoints for <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a>, <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a>, and Arbitrum Sepolia. These endpoints are rate-limited, making them best for:

- Testing and development
- Light usage and general interactions
- Applications with low transaction volume

For more details on the specific RPC endpoints for each chain, please see [this section](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#arbitrum-public-rpc-endpoints) of the documentation.

### Third-party RPC

Third-party node providers offer enhanced performance and higher rate limits. Many providers that support Ethereum also support Arbitrum chains. Use third-party RPCs when you need:

- Higher throughput
- Better performance
- More reliable uptime
- Advanced features like analytics

You can find a list of supported third-party providers [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#third-party-rpc-providers).

### Arbitrum nodes

Running your own Arbitrum node provides maximum control and privacy. Your transactions connect to the Sequencer through the <a data-quicklook-from="sequencer-feed">Sequencer Feed</a>. Consider this option if you need:

- Complete control over transaction handling
- Maximum privacy
- Custom node configurations

Please see the [Arbitrum Node](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/overview) documentation to learn more about setting up and running a node.

### Sequencer endpoint

The Sequencer endpoint provides the fastest path to transaction submission by bypassing the load balancer. This endpoint only supports:

- `eth_sendRawTransaction`
- `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional`

Use this method when you need the lowest possible latency for time-sensitive transactions.

The following diagram shows the four methods for submitting transactions to the Sequencer:

## Bypassing the Sequencer

You can submit transactions directly to the Delayed Inbox contract on the Parent chain without using the Sequencer. This method provides:

- **Censorship resistance** - Transaction inclusion even if the Sequencer refuses to process it
- **Availability guarantee** - Transactions work even when the Sequencer is offline
- **Decentralization** - Reduces dependency on the Sequencer

There are two paths your transaction can take through the Delayed Inbox.

When you submit a transaction to the Delayed Inbox, two things can happen:

1. **Automatic processing** - The Sequencer picks up your transaction and includes it in the normal transaction flow
2. **Force inclusion** - If 24 hours pass without processing, you can call the `forceInclude` function on the `SequencerInbox` contract to guarantee inclusion

This two-path system ensures your transaction will always be processed, even if the Sequencer is unresponsive or censoring transactions.

### Using the Delayed Inbox

To submit a transaction through the Delayed Inbox:

1. **Construct your transaction** and serialize it
2. **Call [`sendL2Message`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol#L150)** with your serialized transaction data
3. **Wait for processing** or force inclusion after 24 hours

### Force inclusion after delays

If your transaction doesn't get processed within 24 hours, call the [`forceInclusion`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L284) function on the `SequencerInbox` contract. This function ensures that transactions get included regardless of the Sequencer's status.

### Using the Arbitrum SDK

The Arbitrum SDK simplifies Delayed Inbox interactions through the [`InboxTools`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/792a7ee3ccf09842653bc49b771671706894cbb4/src/lib/inbox/inbox.ts#L64C14-L64C24) class:
