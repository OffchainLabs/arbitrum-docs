# VM affordances

The Stylus Rust SDK contains several modules for interacting with the Virtual Machine (VM), which can be imported from `stylus_sdk`.

Let's see an example:

import NotForProductionBannerPartial from '../../partials/_not-for-production-banner-partial.mdx';

<NotForProductionBannerPartial />

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{msg};

let callvalue = msg::value();
```

This page lists the modules that are available, as well as the methods within those modules.

## block

Allows you to inspect the current block:

- `basefee`: gets the basefee of the current block
- `chainid`: gets the unique chain identifier of the Arbitrum chain
- `coinbase`: gets the coinbase of the current block, which on Arbitrum chains is the L1 batch poster's address
- `gas_limit`: gets the gas limit of the current block
- `number`: gets a bounded estimate of the L1 block number at which the sequencer sequenced the transaction. See [Block gas limit, numbers and time](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time) for more information on how this value is determined
- `timestamp`: gets a bounded estimate of the Unix timestamp at which the sequencer sequenced the transaction. See [Block gas limit, numbers and time](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time) for more information on how this value is determined

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{block};

let basefee = block::basefee();
let chainid = block::chainid();
let coinbase = block::coinbase();
let gas_limit = block::gas_limit();
let number = block::number();
let timestamp = block::timestamp();
```

## contract

Allows you to inspect the contract itself:

- `address`: gets the address of the current program
- `args`: reads the invocation's calldata. The entrypoint macro uses this under the hood
- `balance`: gets the balance of the current program
- `output`: writes the contract's return data. The entrypoint macro uses this under the hood
- `read_return_data`: copies the bytes of the last EVM call or deployment return result. Note: this function does not revert if out of bounds, but rather will copy the overlapping portion
- `return_data_len`: returns the length of the last EVM call or deployment return result, or 0 if neither have happened during the program's execution

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{contract};

let address = contract::address();
contract::args();
let balance = contract::balance();
contract::output();
contract::read_return_data();
contract::return_data_len();
```

## crypto

Allows you to access VM-accelerated cryptographic functions:

- `keccak`: efficiently computes the [keccak256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) hash of the given preimage

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{crypto};
use stylus_sdk::alloy_primitives::address;

let preimage = address!("361594F5429D23ECE0A88E4fBE529E1c49D524d8");
let hash = crypto::keccak(&preimage);
```

## evm

Allows you to access affordances for the Ethereum Virtual Machine:

- `gas_left`: gets the amount of gas remaining. See [Ink and Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas) for more information on Stylus's compute pricing
- `ink_left`: gets the amount of ink remaining. See [Ink and Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas) for more information on Stylus's compute pricing
- `log`: emits a typed alloy log
- `pay_for_memory_grow`: this function exists to force the compiler to import this symbol. Calling it will unproductively consume gas
- `raw_log`: emits an EVM log from its raw topics and data. Most users should prefer the alloy-typed [raw_log](https://docs.rs/stylus-sdk/latest/stylus_sdk/evm/fn.raw_log.html)

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{evm};

let gas_left = evm::gas_left();
let ink_left = evm::ink_left();
evm::log(...);
evm::pay_for_memory_grow();
evm::raw_log(...);
```

Here's an example of how to emit a Transfer log:

```rust
sol! {
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}

fn foo() {
   ...
   evm::log(Transfer {
      from: Address::ZERO,
      to: address,
      value,
   });
}
```

## msg

Allows you to inspect the current call

- `reentrant`: whether the current call is reentrant
- `sender`: gets the address of the account that called the program. For normal L2-to-L2 transactions the semantics are equivalent to that of the EVM's [CALLER](https://www.evm.codes/#33) opcode, including in cases arising from [DELEGATE_CALL](https://www.evm.codes/#f4)
- `value`: gets the ETH value in wei sent to the program

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{msg};

let reentrant = msg::reentrant();
let sender = msg::sender();
let value = msg::value();
```

## tx

Allows you to inspect the current transaction

- `gas_price`: gets the gas price in wei per gas, which on Arbitrum chains equals the basefee
- `gas_to_ink`: converts evm gas to ink. See [Ink and Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas) for more information on Stylus's compute-pricing model
- `ink_price`: gets the price of ink in evm gas basis points. See [Ink and Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas) for more information on Stylus's compute-pricing model
- `ink_to_gas`: converts ink to evm gas. See [Ink and Gas](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas) for more information on Stylus's compute-pricing model
- `origin`: gets the top-level sender of the transaction. The semantics are equivalent to that of the EVM's [ORIGIN](https://www.evm.codes/#32) opcode

```rust
use stylus_sdk::{tx};

let gas_price = tx::gas_price();
let gas_to_ink = tx::gas_to_ink();
let ink_price = tx::ink_price();
let ink_to_gas = tx::ink_to_gas();
let origin = tx::origin();
```
