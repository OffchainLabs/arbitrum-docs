# Function selector

When a smart contract is called, the first 4 bytes of the calldata sent as part of the request are called the "function selector", and identify which function of the smart contract to call.

You can compute a specific function selector by using the `function_selector!` macro.

Here's an example that computes the selector of a function named `foo`:

import NotForProductionBannerPartial from '../../partials/_not-for-production-banner-partial.mdx';

<NotForProductionBannerPartial />

```rust
function_selector!("foo") // returns 0xc2985578
```

Functions usually take a number of arguments that you need to pass in order for the call to be successful. For example, here's the signature of a function that takes 2 arguments, an address and a uint256:

```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

To compute the selector for this function, pass the types of the arguments to the `function_selector` macro:

```rust
function_selector!("transfer", Address, U256) // returns 0xa9059cbb
```

`function_selector` will return a byte array containing the encoded function selector.
