# Step 4: `auctioneer_submitBidAuctionTransaction`

The auctioneer submits the winning bids to resolve the auction.

1. Auctioneer collects and sorts all valid bids for the round
2. Identifies the two highest bids
3. Calls resolveAuction() with the winning bids

```solidity
function resolveAuction(Bid calldata bid1, Bid calldata bid2) external;
```

After the auction closes, the auctioneer processes all valid bids and determines the winner. In this sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid amount. The contract handles the transfer of funds and stores the winner's address as the express lane controller for the upcoming round.
