# Step 1: Deposit funds into the auction contract

Users must first deposit ERC-20 tokens into the auction contract to participate in bidding.

1. Call `submitDeposit()` on the IExpressLaneAuction contract
2. The contract emits a DepositSubmitted event with the bidder's address and amount
3. Funds are now available for bidding in future auction rounds

```solidity
function submitDeposit(uint256 amount) external;
```

The deposit process establishes a bidder's ability to participate in the auction system by locking tokens that can later be used for bidding. The amount deposited represents the maximum bid a user can make in subsequent rounds.
