# Step 2: `timeboost_submitBid()`

Users submit bids through the auctioneer's RPC API for the upcoming round.

1. Create a bid with chain ID, round number, and bid amount
2. Sign the bid data with your private key
3. Submit the bid via timeboost_submitBid RPC method

```javascript
{
  chain_id: "uint64",
  address: "0x...",
  round: "uint64",
  amount: "uint256",
  signature: "0x..."
}
```

The bid submission is handled via an RPC endpoint rather than directly on-chain to prevent front-running and ensure fair ordering. The signature proves ownership of the address and authorization of the bid amount.
