{"question": "How does gas work on Arbitrum?","answer": "<p>Fees on Arbitrum chains are collected on L2 in the chains' native currency (ETH on both Arbitrum One and Nova).</p>\n\n<p>A transaction fee is comprised of both an L1 and an L2 component:</p>\n\n<p>The L1 component is meant to compensate the Sequencer for the cost of posting transactions on L1 (but no more). (See <a href=\"https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing\">L1 Pricing</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The L2 component covers the cost of operating the L2 chain; it uses Geth for gas calculation and thus behaves nearly identically to L1 Ethereum. One difference is that unlike on Ethereum, Arbitrum chains enforce a gas price floor; currently 0.1 gwei on Arbitrum One and 0.01 gwei on Nova (See <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas\">Gas</a>).</p>\n\n<p>L2 Gas price adjusts responsively to chain congestion, ala EIP 1559.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n","key": "how-does-gas-work-on-arbitrum"},

{"question": "How many block numbers must we wait for in Arbitrum before we can confidently state that the transaction has reached finality?","answer": "<p>Arbitrum's block intervals fluctuate with throughput, so relying on block numbers for finality isn't recommended.

This occurs when the Sequencer's batch is posted as an L1 block on Ethereum and then the batch transactions achieve <code>safe</code> finality there. While safe blocks are typically resistant to re-orgs, they can still be re-orged in the event of a significant L1 re-org.</li>\n<li> <code>finalized</code>: Provides you with the most recent Arbitrum block number that is finalized on Ethereum. This means that the Sequencer's batch has been published<strong> </strong>as an L1 block on the Ethereum network and has reached a substantial depth, making it eligible for hard finality.

{"question": "Why is the fee of some Classic transactions slightly different than the multiplication of gasLimit and effectiveGasPrice?","answer": "<p>Gas prices in Classic transactions worked a bit differently than in Nitro transactions.
